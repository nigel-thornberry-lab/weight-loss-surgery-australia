## üéØ DATA PROCESSING PROMPTS

### Prompt 1: Create Data Enrichment Script

```
I have a CSV file at /data/surgeons-master-clean.csv with the following columns:
- name, address, phone, rating, review_count, website, hours_monday through hours_sunday, latitude, longitude, google_place_id

Create a Node.js script at scripts/enrich-surgeon-data.js that:

1. Reads the CSV file using csv-parser
2. For each surgeon row:
   a) Extract title (Dr., Prof., A/Prof.) from name
   b) Extract first_name and last_name
   c) Extract qualifications (FRACS, MBBS, etc.) using regex: /(FRACS|MBBS|PhD|MD|FACS|GAICD)/g
   d) Generate slug: lowercase(name), replace spaces with hyphens, remove special characters
   e) Estimate years_experience: random between 10-25 (we'll update manually later)
   f) Calculate procedures_performed_estimate: years_experience √ó 150
   g) Calculate priority_score: (rating √ó review_count √ó years_experience) / 10
   h) Assign tier: 
      - tier 1 if priority_score > 500
      - tier 2 if priority_score > 200
      - tier 3 otherwise
   i) Generate meta_title: "[Name] - Bariatric Surgeon [City] | Gastric Sleeve & Bypass"
   j) Generate meta_description: "[Name] is an experienced bariatric surgeon in [City] with [years]+ years experience. Rating: [rating]‚òÖ ([review_count] reviews). Book free consultation today."
   k) Extract city from address using regex
   l) Set default values:
      - procedures_offered: "gastric-sleeve|gastric-bypass|gastric-band"
      - consultation_fee: 250
      - surgery_fees_from: 15000
      - surgery_fees_to: 25000
      - accepts_medicare: true
      - accepts_insurance: true

3. Write enriched data to /data/surgeons-master-enriched.csv with all original columns plus new ones

4. Log progress every 10 surgeons

5. Show summary at end:
   - Total surgeons processed
   - Tier breakdown (how many in each tier)
   - Average rating
   - Cities covered

Use csv-parser and csv-writer libraries. Include proper error handling.
```

---

### Prompt 2: Generate Professional Bios

```
Create a Node.js script at scripts/generate-surgeon-bios.js that:

1. Reads /data/surgeons-master-enriched.csv
2. For each surgeon, generates a professional 600-800 word bio using this template:

"""

  priority_score: number;
  featured: boolean;
}
```

2. Read /data/surgeons-master-final.csv at import time and cache in memory

3. Export these functions:

```typescript
export function getAllSurgeons(): Surgeon[] {
  // Return all surgeons sorted by priority_score descending
}

export function getSurgeonBySlug(slug: string, city: string): Surgeon | null {
  // Find surgeon by slug and city (case-insensitive)
}

export function getSurgeonsByCity(city: string): Surgeon[] {
  // Filter surgeons by city, sorted by priority_score
}

export function getSurgeonsByProcedure(procedure: string): Surgeon[] {
  // Filter surgeons who offer specific procedure
  // procedure parameter like "gastric-sleeve"
}

export function getFeaturedSurgeons(limit: number = 10): Surgeon[] {
  // Get top surgeons by priority_score with featured=true
}

export function searchSurgeons(query: string): Surgeon[] {
  // Search by name, city, suburb, procedures (case-insensitive)
}

  // Split "gastric-sleeve|gastric-bypass" into array
}

export function formatProcedureName(procedure: string): string {
  // Convert "gastric-sleeve" to "Gastric Sleeve"
}
```

Use fs to read CSV, parse with Papa Parse or similar. Include proper error handling. Make it tree-shakeable.

### Prompt 9: Create Sitemap Generator

```
Create scripts/generate-surgeon-sitemap.ts that:

1. Imports all surgeons from data access layer
2. Generates XML sitemap entries for:
   - Each surgeon profile page
   - Each city directory page
   - Main directory page

3. XML format:
```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://wlsaustralia.com.au/surgeons/sydney/dr-john-smith</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-01-04</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.8</priority>
</url>
```

4. Writes to public/sitemap-surgeons.xml

5. Logs summary:
   - Total URLs added
   - URLs by type (profiles, directories)

Run with: npx tsx scripts/generate-surgeon-sitemap.ts

Use fs and path modules. Include error handling.
```

---

### Prompt 10: Create Page Generator Script

```
Create scripts/generate-surgeon-pages.ts that programmatically generates Astro pages:

1. Reads all surgeons from CSV
2. Groups by city
3. For each city:
   - Creates /src/pages/surgeons/[city-slug]/ directory
   - Generates individual [surgeon-slug].astro for each surgeon

4. Each generated file should import the surgeon data dynamically, not embed it:

```astro
---
import Layout from '@/layouts/Layout.astro';
import { getSurgeonBySlug } from '@/data/surgeons';
import SurgeonHero from '@/components/surgeons/SurgeonHero.astro';
// ... other imports

const { slug } = Astro.params;
const surgeon = getSurgeonBySlug(slug, '[CITY]');

if (!surgeon) {
  return Astro.redirect('/404');
}
---

<Layout title={surgeon.meta_title} description={surgeon.meta_description}>
  <SurgeonHero surgeon={surgeon} />
  <!-- ... other components -->
</Layout>
```

5. Logging:
   - Show progress: "Generating sydney/dr-john-smith.astro"
   - Show summary at end

6. Add --dry-run flag to preview without writing

7. Make it idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

Use TypeScript. Include proper error handling.
```

2. Search functions:
   - getSurgeonBySlug finds correct surgeon
   - getSurgeonsByCity filters correctly
   - getSurgeonsByProcedure filters correctly
   - searchSurgeons returns relevant results

3. Helper functions:
   - formatPhoneNumber returns correct format
   - getProcedureList splits correctly
   - formatProcedureName capitalizes correctly

4. Schema generation:
   - generateSurgeonSchema returns valid schema
   - All required fields present
   - Valid JSON-LD format

```

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT PROMPTS

### Prompt 12: Create Deployment Checklist Script

```
Create scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts that validates:

1. All surgeon pages have:
   - Valid meta title (50-60 chars)
   - Valid meta description (150-160 chars)
   - Valid schema markup (parse and validate)
   - Working phone numbers (format check)
   - Valid image URLs (if present)

2. No broken internal links

3. All pages build successfully

4. Sitemap is up to date

5. robots.txt allows surgeon pages

Output:
- ‚úÖ for passing checks
- ‚ùå for failing checks
- List of issues to fix

Run with: npx tsx scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts

Return exit code 0 if all pass, 1 if any fail (for CI/CD).
```

---

## üí° TIPS FOR USING THESE PROMPTS

1. **Copy-paste as-is** - These prompts are designed to be used directly
2. **Run in sequence** - Follow the order for best results
3. **Review output** - Always check generated code before using
4. **Iterate** - If output isn't quite right, ask Claude to refine it
5. **Combine prompts** - You can ask Claude to do multiple related tasks together

**Example iteration:**
```
Claude, the bio you generated is too generic. Can you make it more specific to the surgeon's experience and add more personality? Also include a section about their patient care philosophy.
```
