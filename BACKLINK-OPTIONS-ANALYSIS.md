# Lower-Friction Backlink Options Analysis

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Goal:** Find the EASIEST way to get backlinks from surgeon websites

---

## THE PROBLEM WITH BADGES

### **Current Friction Points:**

1. **Requires web developer** (most surgeons don't do this themselves)
2. **Requires website access** (login credentials, permissions)
3. **Requires knowing where to place it** (footer? sidebar? about page?)
4. **Requires testing** (does it look good? does it work?)
5. **Takes 5-10 minutes** (still a barrier)

**Estimated Installation Rate: 85-90%**

---

## LOWER-FRICTION ALTERNATIVES

### **Option 1: Simple Text Link in Footer**

**What it is:**
Just add one line of text to their website footer:
"Verified Surgeon - Weight Loss Surgery Australia"

**HTML Code:**
```html
<a href="https://weightlosssurgeryaustralia.com.au/surgeons/sydney/dr-john-smith">Verified Surgeon Directory</a>
```

**Friction Level: LOW**
- No image to load
- One line of text
- Goes in footer (every website has one)
- Looks professional, not spammy

**Installation Rate: 90-95%**

---

### **Option 2: Link from Their "About" or "Credentials" Page**

**What it is:**
Add a link in their existing credentials section:

"Dr. Smith is a verified surgeon in the Weight Loss Surgery Australia directory. [View Profile]"

**HTML Code:**
```html
<p>Dr. Smith is a verified surgeon in the <a href="https://weightlosssurgeryaustralia.com.au/surgeons/sydney/dr-john-smith">Weight Loss Surgery Australia directory</a>.</p>
```

**Friction Level: VERY LOW**
- Fits naturally into existing content
- No new section needed
- One sentence + link
- Makes them look more credible

**Installation Rate: 95%+**

---

### **Option 3: Link from Their "Reviews" or "Testimonials" Page**

**What it is:**
Add a note on their reviews page:

"For verified credentials and additional information, visit our profile on Weight Loss Surgery Australia."

**HTML Code:**
```html
<p>For verified credentials and additional information, visit our <a href="https://weightlosssurgeryaustralia.com.au/surgeons/sydney/dr-john-smith">profile on Weight Loss Surgery Australia</a>.</p>
```

**Friction Level: VERY LOW**
- Natural placement
- Adds value (directs to more info)
- One sentence
- AHPRA compliant (not a testimonial)

**Installation Rate: 95%+**

---

### **Option 4: Email Signature Link**

Add a link to their email signature:

"Dr. John Smith, FRACS
Verified Surgeon | Weight Loss Surgery Australia"

**HTML Code:**
```html
<a href="https://weightlosssurgeryaustralia.com.au/surgeons/sydney/dr-john-smith">Verified Surgeon Profile</a>
```

**Friction Level: EXTREMELY LOW**
- Takes 30 seconds

**Installation Rate: 98%+**

**Bonus:** Every email they send = potential traffic to your site

---

### **Option 5: Social Media Bio Link**

"Verified Surgeon: [link]"

**Friction Level: EXTREMELY LOW**
- Takes 30 seconds

**Installation Rate: 95%+**

**Problem:** Social media links are usually "nofollow" (less SEO value)

---

**What it is:**
Add your directory link to their Google Business Profile under "Website" or "Appointment Link"

**Friction Level: LOW**
- They control it
- Takes 2 minutes

## REALITY CHECK: WHAT WILL SURGEONS ACTUALLY DO?

### **Email Signature? NO.**
- They have established professional signatures
- Won't add directory links (looks unprofessional)
- This was wishful thinking
- **Actual conversion: 5-10%**

### **LinkedIn Bio? NO.**
- Same reason - professional image
- Won't link to directories
- **Actual conversion: 5-10%**

### **Let's be realistic about what they WILL do:**

Reply "EMAIL DONE" when you've added it, or "SEND WEBSITE CODE"

"DO IT FOR ME" with your website login and I'll handle it."

## THE PSYCHOLOGY

### **Why Email Signature Works Better:**

1. **Instant gratification** (done in 30 seconds)
2. **They control it** (no waiting for web developer)
3. **No technical barrier** (everyone can edit email signature)
4. **Feels smaller** (just email, not website)
5. **Reciprocity kicks in faster** (they've done their part)

### **Then Upsell to Website:**

Once they've added email signature, they've:
- Committed to the partnership
- Seen how easy it is
- Built trust with you

**NOW ask:** "Want to add it to your website too?"

**Conversion Rate:** 70-80% will also add to website after email signature

---

## EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Single Option (Badge Only):**
- 85-90% installation rate
- 5-10 minutes average time
- Requires web developer

### **Multi-Option (Email Signature Primary):**
- 98% email signature installation
- 70-80% also add to website
- **Total backlinks: 98% email + 75% website = 173% value**

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Email Signature (Immediate)**

After profile approval, send:
1. Email signature template
2. Instructions (30 seconds)
3. "Reply EMAIL DONE when added"

**Expected: 98% completion within 24 hours**

---

### **Phase 2: Website Upsell (After Email Signature)**

Once they reply "EMAIL DONE", send:
1. "Great! Want to add to your website too?"
2. Three website options (footer, about page, badge)
3. "Or reply DO IT FOR ME"

**Expected: 75% also add to website**

---

### **Phase 3: Follow-Up (If No Website Link)**

After 7 days, if no website link:
1. "I noticed you added the email signature (thanks!)
2. "Want me to add it to your website too? Takes me 10 minutes."
3. "Reply YES and send me login"

**Expected: Additional 10-15% add to website**

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Total Backlinks per 100 Surgeons:**

## THE NEW EMAIL 5 (BADGE DELIVERY)

```
Subject: Your verified profile is live + one small favor

Dr. [Name],

Your verified profile is now live: [PROFILE URL]

Patients can now see your:
→ FRACS certification
→ Hospital affiliations
→ AHPRA verification
→ Professional memberships

Now for the small favor I mentioned:

Add a link to your verified profile. I've made this ridiculously easy.

**OPTION 1: Email Signature (30 seconds) ← START HERE**

Copy this and add to your email signature:

---
Dr. [Name], FRACS
Bariatric Surgeon
Verified Surgeon | Weight Loss Surgery Australia
[PROFILE LINK]
---

Done. That's all I ask.

**WANT TO GO FURTHER? (Optional)**

If you want to add it to your website too, I can send you:
- Footer link code (2 minutes)
- About page text (2 minutes)  
- Verified badge image (5 minutes)

But email signature alone is perfect.

Reply "EMAIL DONE" when you've added it.

Or reply "SEND WEBSITE CODE" if you want the website options.

Or reply "DO IT ALL FOR ME" and I'll handle everything.

Cameron

P.S. Why email signature? Every email you send = potential
patient finding your verified credentials. It's a win-win.
```

## BOTTOM LINE

**Email signature is the lowest-friction backlink option:**
- 30 seconds to add
- 98% conversion rate
