# Surgeon Name Cleanup - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up surgeon profile names to be more professional and user-friendly by removing business names, locations, and other unnecessary text. Names now only include the title (Dr, Mr, Prof, etc.) and the actual name.

## Problem Identified
Many surgeon profiles had extremely long names that included:
- Business names (e.g., "Victorian Specialist Surgery & Weight Loss Centre")
- Locations (e.g., "Melbourne", "Sydney")
- Specializations (e.g., "Upper-GI & Weight Loss Surgeon")
- Other unnecessary text

This caused issues with:
- Messy URLs and slugs
- Unprofessional appearance in bios
- Poor user experience
- SEO issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Name Cleaning Scripts Created
- **`clean-surgeon-names.cjs`** - Initial attempt with CSV parsing issues
- **`clean-surgeon-names-v2.cjs`** - Improved CSV parsing
- **`fix-surgeon-names-targeted.cjs`** - Targeted approach for specific patterns
- **`fix-surgeon-names-final.cjs`** - Final working version

### 2. Name Mapping Generated
Created `surgeon-name-mapping-final.json` with 14 surgeon name mappings:

**Examples of cleaned names:**
- `"Mr.Niruben Rajasagaram - Victorian Specialist Surgery & Weight Loss Centre"` → `"Mr.Niruben Rajasagaram"`
- `"Dr Devesh Kaushal | Upper-GI & Weight Loss Surgeon"` → `"Dr Devesh Kaushal"`
- `"Dr Jason Maani Gallbladder Surgery"` → `"Dr Jason Maani"`
- `"Mr Jacob Vanyai | MOGGS | Melbourne Oesophagogastric and General Surgery | East Melbourne"` → `"Mr Jacob Vanyai"`

### 3. Files Updated

#### CSV Data Files
- **`surgeons-complete-data-final.csv`** - Updated with cleaned names and new slugs
- All surgeon names cleaned to professional format
- Slugs updated to use clean names (e.g., `niruben-rajasagaram-berwick`)

#### JSON Data Files
- **`src/data/slug-to-placeid.json`** - Updated slug mappings
- **`place-id-mapping.json`** - Updated slug references
- All other JSON files checked and updated as needed

#### Page Files
- **Renamed files:**
  - `mrniruben-rajasagaram-victorian-specialist-surgery-weight-loss-centre-berwick.astro` → `niruben-rajasagaram-berwick.astro`
  - `mrniruben-rajasagaram-victorian-specialist-surgery-weight-loss-centre-frankston.astro` → `niruben-rajasagaram-frankston.astro`

- **Updated content:**
  - Surgeon names in frontmatter
  - Slugs in frontmatter and code
  - Bio text cleaned to use short names
  - Index files updated with new slug references

### 4. Bio Text Cleanup
- **`clean-bio-text.cjs`** - Script to clean bio text in all surgeon pages
- Processed 69 surgeon files
- Updated 13 files with cleaned bio text
- Replaced long business names with clean surgeon names throughout bio content

## Results

### Before
