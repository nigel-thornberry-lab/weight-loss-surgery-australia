## 2. ✅ Phone Number Standardization

```
1. Remove all non-numeric characters
2. Add country code (61) if missing
3. Format consistently: (0X) XXXX XXXX
   - Standard: (02) 9876 5432
   - 1300: 1300 123 456
   - 1800: 1800 123 456
```

### Examples
| Original | Cleaned |
|----------|---------|
| `+61 2 9601 4000` | `(02) 9601 4000` |
| `+61 1300 376 243` | `1300 376 243` |
| `+61 3 9852 3777` | `(03) 9852 3777` |
| `+61 493 557 733` | `(04) 9355 7733` |

**Result:** 424 of 440 records have valid phone numbers

---

## 3. ✅ Address Cleaning

### Process
1. **Street Addresses**: Applied title case (e.g., "Suite 30, Level 2/20-24 Gibbs St")
2. **State Standardization**: Converted full names to abbreviations
   - "New South Wales" → "NSW"
   - "Victoria" → "VIC"
3. **City Names**: Applied title case for consistency

### State Distribution
| State | Count |
|-------|-------|
| VIC | 235 (59.5%) |
| NSW | 157 (39.7%) |
| Other | 3 (0.8%) |

### Primary Locations
| Location | Count |

| Other | 219 (55.4%) |
| Melbourne | 95 (24.1%) |
| Sydney | 79 (20.0%) |
| Unknown | 2 (0.5%) |

## 4. ✅ Procedure Categorization

### Detection Algorithm
Analyzed `business_name` and `categoryName` fields for procedure keywords:

```python
Procedures Detected:
- gastric-sleeve: "gastric sleeve", "sleeve gastrectomy", "VSG"
- gastric-bypass: "gastric bypass", "RYGB"
- mini-gastric-bypass: "mini gastric bypass", "omega loop"
- gastric-band: "gastric band", "lap band"
- gastric-balloon: "gastric balloon", "intragastric balloon"
- duodenal-switch: "duodenal switch", "BPD-DS"
- general-bariatric: Generic bariatric/weight loss terms
```

### Results
| Procedure Category | Count |
|-------------------|-------|
| No specific procedure | 321 (81.3%) |
| General bariatric | 72 (18.2%) |
| Gastric sleeve | 2 (0.5%) |

**Note:** Most surgeons don't specify procedures in their business names. Manual review recommended for more detailed procedure mapping.

## 5. ✅ Qualification Extraction

### Process
Extracted medical qualifications and titles from surgeon names:

```python
Titles: Dr, Mr, Ms, Mrs, Professor, Prof, A/Prof
Post-nominals: FRACS, MBBS, GAICD, FACS, PhD, MD, FRCS, etc.
```

### Examples
| Original Name | Surgeon Name | Qualifications |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| `Dr. Mark Magdy` | `Mark Magdy` | `Dr.` |
