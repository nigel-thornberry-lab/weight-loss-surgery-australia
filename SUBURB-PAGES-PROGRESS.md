## 💡 Workflow Efficiency Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Batch research:** Perplexity MCP with 6 queries per suburb = comprehensive data in 10-12 min
2. **Template consistency:** Building pages at Liverpool standard from start (Batch 3 approach)
3. **Streamlined workflow:** Research → Create → Deploy in ~2 hours for 5 pages
4. **Real-time deployment:** Git commit → Vercel auto-deploy = immediate verification

### Optimizations for Next 15 Suburbs (Melbourne)
1. **Built-at-standard approach:** Create pages at Liverpool quality from start (faster than enhance later)
2. **Parallel research:** Batch 5 suburbs simultaneously using Perplexity
3. **Hub page updates:** Update Melbourne hub as batches complete
4. **Consolidated documentation:** Single research + completion doc per batch
