## Email Body

Hi,

This is our final email in the series.

Over the past three weeks, we've covered:
- The realistic timeline and what to expect
- The true costs and how people pay for it
- Mental and emotional preparation
- How to choose a surgeon
- Your most pressing questions answered

By now, you have more information than most people get before making this decision.

**The question is: What do you do with it?**

## The Decision Framework

Here's a simple way to evaluate whether you're ready to book a consultation (not surgery—just a consultation).

### ✅ You're Probably Ready for a Consultation If:

**You can honestly say yes to most of these:**

1. **I understand this is a tool, not a cure**
   - You know surgery changes your stomach, but you'll still need to change your habits

2. **I've exhausted other options** (or they're not suitable for me)
   - You've tried supervised diet and exercise programs without sustainable results
   - Or your health conditions make surgery a more appropriate option

3. **I have realistic expectations**
   - You understand weight loss takes time (12-24 months for most of it)
   - You know there are risks, complications, and lifestyle requirements
   - You're not expecting perfect—you're expecting better

4. **I'm doing this for me**
   - Not for a partner, family member, or doctor
   - Not to "prove something" or meet someone else's standards

5. **I have (or can build) a support system**
   - At least one or two people who will support you through this
   - Willingness to join support groups or seek professional help

6. **I can commit to the requirements**
   - Lifelong vitamin supplementation
   - Regular follow-up appointments
   - Dietary guidelines (especially in the first 6-12 months)
   - Mental health support if needed

7. **The timing is reasonable**
   - No major life upheavals happening right now (recent divorce, job loss, bereavement)
   - You're in a stable enough place to dedicate energy to recovery

8. **I can afford it** (or have a plan to)
   - You've explored insurance, payment plans, or superannuation options
   - The financial commitment won't put you in a crisis situation

---

### ⏸️ You Might Want to Wait If:

**It's okay to not be ready yet. Consider pausing if:**

1. **You're still hoping for a quick fix**
   - If you're thinking "I'll have surgery and everything will be solved"

2. **You haven't addressed underlying mental health issues**
   - Untreated depression, anxiety, eating disorders, or trauma
   - These don't disqualify you forever—just need to be addressed first

3. **You're facing major life stress right now**
   - Adding surgery recovery to an already overwhelming situation rarely goes well

4. **You're doing this for someone else**
   - External motivation rarely sustains through the hard parts

5. **You don't understand the risks**
   - If you haven't read about complications, long-term requirements, or potential regrets

6. **The financial burden would be crushing**
   - If paying for this would put you in genuine financial distress

7. **You haven't researched your surgeon options**
   - Booking with the first surgeon you find without due diligence is risky

**Waiting doesn't mean giving up**—it means getting yourself in the right position for success.

## What "Ready for Consultation" Actually Means

Let's be clear: **booking a consultation is not committing to surgery**.

A consultation is an information-gathering session where you:
- Meet the surgeon and assess if you trust them
- Ask questions specific to your situation
- Get a medical assessment of your eligibility
- Understand their specific program and costs
- Decide if you want to move forward with **this** surgeon

**You can (and should) consult with multiple surgeons before deciding.**

Most people consult with 2-3 surgeons. Some consult and decide not to proceed at all. That's completely fine.

---

## Your Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Path 1: Book a Consultation

If you're feeling ready, here's what to do:

1. **Choose 2-3 surgeons to consult with**
   - Use our surgeon directory: [Browse Surgeons →](/surgeons)
   - Filter by location, procedure, and hospital affiliation
   - Look for FRACS qualification and bariatric specialization

2. **Prepare for your consultations**
   - Download our surgeon selection checklist: [Get Checklist →](/surgeon-selection-checklist)
   - Write down your specific questions
   - Bring your medical history and current medications list

3. **Book appointments**
   - Expect to wait 2-8 weeks for initial consultations (varies by surgeon)
   - Budget $200-$500 per consultation (often rebated by Medicare partially)

4. **Attend with an open mind**
   - Take notes
   - Ask about everything that concerns you
   - Pay attention to how you're treated

5. **Make your decision**
   - Compare surgeons based on credentials, approach, cost, and gut feeling
   - Take your time—don't let anyone rush you

### Path 2: Keep Researching

If you're not quite ready, that's okay. Here's what you can do:

**Explore specific topics:**
- [What's recovery really like?](/blog/gastric-sleeve-recovery-week-by-week)
- [Compare procedures side-by-side](/compare/gastric-sleeve-vs-gastric-bypass)
- [Understand the costs in detail](/cost-calculator)
- [Assess your emotional readiness](/am-i-ready)

**Stay informed:**
- Browse our blog for recipes, guides, and honest information: [Visit Blog →](/blog)
- Check out suburb-specific resources if you're in Sydney or Melbourne: [Sydney →](/locations/sydney) | [Melbourne →](/locations/melbourne)

**Join communities:**
- Online support groups (Facebook, Reddit) where people share real experiences
- Australian-specific groups are helpful for insurance and funding questions

**Work on readiness:**
- Address mental health concerns with a therapist
- Improve your financial situation
- Build your support system
- Wait for life circumstances to stabilize

---

### Path 3: Decide This Isn't for You

And that's completely okay.

Not everyone chooses surgery, and that doesn't mean you've failed or given up.

**Other paths forward:**
- Medically supervised weight management programs
- GLP-1 medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro) if appropriate
- Ongoing work with dietitians and exercise physiologists
- Focus on health markers (blood sugar, blood pressure, mobility) rather than weight
- Accepting where you are and shifting focus to other life goals

**There's no "right" choice**—only what's right for you, in this moment, with the information you have.

## Editor Notes

- **Consultation costs**: $200-$500 range is typical—some surgeons offer bulk-billed initial consults
- **Waiting periods**: 2-8 weeks is general guidance—some surgeons have longer waits
- **Path 3 alternatives**: Medication and acceptance presented equally to surgery—intentionally non-hierarchical
- **Archive link**: Currently notes "future enhancement"—should be implemented
- **Unsubscribe clarity**: Important to explain they completed the nurture sequence
- **General newsletter mention**: Assumes separate newsletter exists—verify
- **Referral ask**: Soft touch in P.S.—not heavy-handed
- **No abandonment**: Even readers choosing "wait" or "not for me" have clear value
- **Future sequence idea**: "Post-Surgery Success" could be natural follow-on for surgical patients
- **Re-engagement opportunity**: Could create "6-month check-in" email for those who didn't book
