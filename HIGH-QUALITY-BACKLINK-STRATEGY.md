# High-Quality Backlink Strategy - Beyond Footer Links

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Reality Check:** Footer links are low-quality. We need a better approach.

---

## THE FOOTER LINK PROBLEM

### **Why Google Doesn't Value Footer Links:**

1. **Sitewide links** - Appears on every page (looks manipulative)
2. **No contextual relevance** - Not related to page content
3. **Common spam tactic** - Used by low-quality directories
4. **Low editorial value** - Not a genuine endorsement
5. **Template-based** - Not natural content

**Google's View:** Footer links = low trust signal

**SEO Value:** Minimal to none

**We've been planning a low-value strategy.** ðŸ˜¬

---

## WHAT GOOGLE ACTUALLY VALUES

### **High-Quality Backlinks Have:**

1. **Contextual relevance** - Within actual content, not templates
2. **Editorial placement** - Naturally mentioned in text
3. **Single-page occurrence** - Not sitewide
4. **Relevant anchor text** - Describes the link naturally
5. **Authoritative source** - From credible, relevant sites

**Example of HIGH-quality backlink:**

A surgeon writes in their "About" page:
"I'm proud to be a verified surgeon in the Weight Loss Surgery 
Australia directory, which provides comprehensive information 
for patients considering bariatric surgery."

**vs.**

**Example of LOW-quality backlink:**

Footer on every page:
"Verified Surgeon Badge [link]"

---

## THE NEW STRATEGY: CONTEXTUAL CONTENT LINKS

### **Option 1: About Page Mention (HIGHEST VALUE)**

**What we ask for:**

"Add a paragraph to your About or Credentials page mentioning 
your verification:

'Dr. [Name] is a verified surgeon in the Weight Loss Surgery 
Australia directory, which provides independent verification 
of surgeon credentials, experience, and qualifications for 
patients researching bariatric surgery options.'

[Link on 'Weight Loss Surgery Australia directory']"

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Contextual (within relevant content)
- âœ… Editorial (natural mention)
- âœ… Single page (not sitewide)
- âœ… Relevant anchor text
- âœ… **HIGH SEO value**

**Realistic Conversion: 60-70%**

---

### **Option 2: Resources Page Link (HIGH VALUE)**

**What we ask for:**

Many surgeon websites have a "Patient Resources" or "Helpful Links" page.

**The ask:**

"Add us to your Patient Resources page:

Weight Loss Surgery Australia
Comprehensive directory of verified bariatric surgeons across 
Australia. Provides independent credential verification and 
patient education resources.
[Link]"

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Natural placement (resources belong here)
- âœ… Provides value to their patients
- âœ… Editorial context
- âœ… **HIGH SEO value**

**Realistic Conversion: 70-80%**

---

### **Option 3: Blog Post Mention (HIGHEST VALUE)**

**What we ask for:**

"Would you be willing to mention your verification in a blog post?

For example, if you write about 'Choosing a Bariatric Surgeon' 
or 'What to Look for in a Weight Loss Surgery Provider', you 
could mention:

'One way to verify a surgeon's credentials is through independent 
directories like Weight Loss Surgery Australia, where I maintain 
a verified profile.'

I can even help you write the blog post if you'd like."

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Contextual (within relevant content)
- âœ… Editorial (natural mention)
- âœ… Provides value to readers
- âœ… **HIGHEST SEO value**

**Realistic Conversion: 30-40%** (more work, but highest value)

---

### **Option 4: Press/Media Page Link (HIGH VALUE)**

**What we ask for:**

Many surgeons have a "Press" or "Media" or "As Featured In" page.

**The ask:**

"Add your verified profile to your Press/Media page:

Verified Surgeon Profile
Weight Loss Surgery Australia
[Date] - [Link]"

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Natural placement (credentials/features)
- âœ… Adds credibility to their site
- âœ… Editorial context
- âœ… **HIGH SEO value**

**Realistic Conversion: 50-60%**

---

## THE INTERVIEW STRATEGY (GENIUS MOVE)

### **This is where the interview becomes CRITICAL:**

**After you publish their interview, you ask:**

"Your interview is now live on our site. Many surgeons like to 
share this with their patients.

Would you like to add a link to your interview on your website?

Suggested placements:
- About page: 'Read my full interview about my approach to 
  bariatric surgery'
- Blog: 'I was recently interviewed about...'
- News/Press page: 'Featured Interview - [Date]'

I can send you the exact text to add, or help you write a 
short blog post about it."

**Why This is BRILLIANT:**

1. **They want to share it** (it makes them look good)
2. **It's their content** (about them, not promotional)
3. **Natural link** (linking to interview about themselves)
4. **High SEO value** (contextual, editorial, relevant)
5. **Easy ask** (they're proud of the interview)

**Realistic Conversion: 80-90%**

**This is the real backlink strategy.**

## THE COMPLETE REVISED STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Profile Verification (Emails 1-4)**
Get them to approve their profile.

### **Phase 2: Interview (Emails 6-8)**
Get them to do the 10-question interview.

### **Phase 3: Interview Publication (Email 9)**
Publish interview on your site + blog post.

### **Phase 4: Backlink Request (NEW Email 10)**

**Subject:** "Your interview is live - want to share it?"

```
Dr. [Name],

Your interview is now live:

Profile: [PROFILE URL]
Blog: [BLOG URL]

I've had several surgeons tell me they share this with patients
because it helps them understand their approach and philosophy.

If you'd like to share it on your website, here are some ideas:

**OPTION 1: About Page Mention**
Add this paragraph to your About page:

"I was recently interviewed by Weight Loss Surgery Australia 
about my approach to bariatric surgery. You can read the full 
interview here: [link]"

**OPTION 2: Blog Post**
Write a short blog post (or I can help you write it):

"I recently sat down with Weight Loss Surgery Australia to 
discuss my philosophy on patient care, surgical approach, and 
what makes a successful bariatric surgery journey. Read the 
full interview: [link]"

**OPTION 3: Press/News Page**
Add to your Press or Media page:

"Featured Interview: Weight Loss Surgery Australia
[Date] - [link]"

**OPTION 4: Patient Resources**
Add to your Patient Resources page:

"For more information about my approach and philosophy, see 
my interview with Weight Loss Surgery Australia: [link]"

Pick whichever feels most natural for your website.

Or if you prefer not to share it, that's fine too. The interview
is live and working regardless.

"HELP ME WRITE IT" and I'll draft something for you to review.

**Why This Works:**

2. **Multiple easy options** (pick what fits)
3. **No pressure** ("that's fine too")
4. **Offer to help** (write blog post for them)
5. **Natural, contextual link** (high SEO value)

**Expected Conversion: 80-90%**

### **NEW STRATEGY (Contextual Interview Link):**
- Location: About page, blog, resources (contextual)

This interview covers:

"Read my full interview about my approach to bariatric surgery 
with Weight Loss Surgery Australia: [link]"

## IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES NEEDED

### **What to Update:**

4. **Create expert quote program** for ongoing content
5. **Build case study program** for patient success stories

### **What to Build:**

2. **Blog post ghostwriting service** (help them write about interview)
3. **Co-authoring workflow** (topic ideas, drafting process)
4. **Expert quote system** (regular outreach for quotes)
5. **Case study template** (patient success story format)

---

## BOTTOM LINE

### **The Footer Badge Was Wrong:**

- Low SEO value
- Looks spammy
- Hard to get installed
- Not what Google values

### **The Interview Link Is Right:**

- High SEO value
- Natural and editorial
- Easy to get (they want to share)
- Exactly what Google values

### **The Content Partnership Is Best:**

- Highest SEO value
- Ongoing relationship
- Multiple backlinks per surgeon
- Builds real authority

---

## THE REVISED PITCH (Email 1)

**Remove this:**
"One small thing I'll ask after you approve:
Add a 'Verified Surgeon' badge to your website footer..."

**Replace with:**
"After you approve, I'll invite you to do a short interview 
about your approach and philosophy. 

Many surgeons share this interview on their website because 
it helps patients understand their approach before booking 
a consultation.

It's a great way to differentiate yourself and show your 
expertise."

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Focuses on THEIR benefit (differentiation)
- âœ… Natural link building (they want to share)
- âœ… High SEO value (contextual, editorial)
- âœ… No "small favor" needed (they benefit directly)

---

**Footer links are dead. Contextual content links are the future.** ðŸŽ¯
