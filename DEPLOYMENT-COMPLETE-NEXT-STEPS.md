## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Custom Domain Required for SEO

### Current Situation:
Your site is deployed at: `https://weight-loss-surgery-australia-q4wkxrnvh.vercel.app/`

**Problem:** ALL `*.vercel.app` URLs have `x-robots-tag: noindex` (even production)
**Solution:** Add your custom domain `weightlosssurgery.com.au` in Vercel

---

## 🔧 How to Add Custom Domain in Vercel

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: **weight-loss-surgery-australia**
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Domains**

### Step 2: Add Your Domain
1. Click **"Add Domain"**
2. Enter: `weightlosssurgery.com.au`
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Also add: `www.weightlosssurgery.com.au` (optional but recommended)

### Step 3: Configure DNS
Vercel will provide DNS instructions. You'll need to add:

**For Apex Domain (weightlosssurgery.com.au):**
- Type: `A` Record
- Name: `@`
- Value: `76.76.21.21` (Vercel's IP)

**For WWW (www.weightlosssurgery.com.au):**
- Type: `CNAME`
- Name: `www`
- Value: `cname.vercel-dns.com`

### Step 4: Verify
After DNS propagates (can take 5-60 minutes):
```bash
curl -I https://weightlosssurgery.com.au/ | grep -i robots
```
Should show **NO** `x-robots-tag: noindex`
