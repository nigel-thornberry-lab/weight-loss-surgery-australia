## ‚ùå Inaccuracies Found & Corrected

### 1. **Processing Time Claims - INCORRECT**

**Original Claims (Multiple locations):**
- "ATO approval typically takes 2-8 weeks to process"
- "2-8 weeks" timeline repeated in Quick Answer, How It Works, schema markup

**Verified Reality (Official ATO):**
- **Online applications:** Up to 14 days (business days)
- **Paper applications:** Up to 28 days
- Source: [ATO Official Guidance](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/super/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/early-access-to-super/access-on-compassionate-grounds/how-to-apply-for-release-on-compassionate-grounds)

**‚úÖ Corrected to:**
- "ATO processes applications in up to 14 days (online) or 28 days (paper)"
- Schema markup: Changed from "P4W" to "P28D"
- Applied consistently across all 4 mentions

**Why It Matters:**
- Original claim overstated processing time by 2-4x
- Sets incorrect expectations for applicants
- Official ATO data is faster than claimed

---

### 2. **Surgery Cost Range - PARTIALLY INACCURATE**

**Original Claim:**
- "Weight loss surgery typically costs $15,000-$30,000"

**Verified Reality (Multiple Australian medical sources):**
- **Gastric Sleeve:** $12,500-$25,000
- **Gastric Bypass:** $14,000-$30,000
- **Combined range:** $12,500-$30,000
- Sources: Complete Weight Loss Solutions, Central Coast Surgery, Juniper, Pilot, Melbourne Obesity Surgery, Kontiki Medical

**‚úÖ Corrected to:**
- "Weight loss surgery typically costs $12,500-$30,000"

**Why It Matters:**
- Original claim excluded lower end of cost spectrum
- Gastric sleeve procedures can be cheaper than stated
- More accurate range helps patients budget correctly

---

### 3. **Unverifiable Social Proof - REMOVED**

**Original Claim:**
- "Hundreds of Australians have successfully funded their weight loss surgery through compassionate release of superannuation"

**Research Findings:**
- **General medical super release:** 21,790 Australians in 2023-24 (ATO official stats)
- **Weight loss surgery specifically:** NO current official data
- **Historical data:** 2016 government report showed ~1,858 bariatric approvals in one quarter
- **Conclusion:** Cannot verify "hundreds" claim for weight loss surgery specifically

**‚úÖ Changed to:**
- "Over 20,000 Australians accessed their superannuation for medical treatment in 2023-24 via compassionate grounds release (ATO statistics)"
- Added source citation: "Source: ATO Compassionate Release Statistics 2023-24"

**Why It Matters:**
- Original claim was speculative without current data
- New claim uses official, verifiable ATO statistics
- More credible and defensible
- Still provides social proof but with legitimate backing
