## üí° KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **Perplexity MCP is perfect for local business research**
   - Gets exact addresses, phone numbers, and ratings
   - Confirms which hospitals serve which suburbs
   - Finds specialist dietitians with bariatric experience

2. **Hospital Location Research Improved Page Quality**
   - Geelong: Switched from Epworth (10km) to St John of God (1km) - much better!
   - Dandenong: Mulgrave Private is more appropriate than Monash Private
   - Each suburb now has the most relevant hospital option

3. **Batch Processing Saves Massive Time**
   - Python scripts for bulk updates across multiple pages
   - Fixed 127 surgeon profiles in minutes vs. hours manually
   - Regex patterns for consistent replacements

4. **Template-Based Creation is Efficient**
   - Copy best page (Geelong), modify with new data
   - Consistent structure across all pages
   - Easy to maintain and update

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Pre-existing Schema Errors:** Found and fixed 127 surgeon profile JSON-LD syntax errors
2. **Hospital Selection:** Had to research best hospital for each suburb (not just closest)
3. **Data Verification:** Ensured all pharmacies and addresses are real and current
