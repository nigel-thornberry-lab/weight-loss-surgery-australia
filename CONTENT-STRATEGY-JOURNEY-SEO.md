# Journey-Based Content Strategy: SEO Master Plan

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive content plan to capture 80,000+ monthly journey-based searches  
**Compliance:** 100% AHPRA compliant (evidence-based, no testimonials)

---

## Executive Summary

**Opportunity:** 80,000-100,000 monthly searches for journey-based keywords (currently capturing ~5%)  
**Goal:** Capture 30-40% within 12 months through comprehensive journey content  
**Approach:** 150+ high-quality articles mapped to 9 journey stages  
**Timeline:** 12 months, 3-4 articles per week  
**Impact:** +50,000-70,000 organic monthly visitors

---

## Content Philosophy: The Journey Framework

### Current Problem:
- Most bariatric surgery content focuses on **procedures** (what is gastric sleeve?)
- Very little content covers **journey stages** (how do I prepare? what's recovery like?)
- Journey keywords have **10x higher volume** than procedure keywords
- Journey content has **higher engagement** (longer sessions, more pages per visit)

### Our Solution:
Create the **most comprehensive journey resource in Australia**:
- Content for **every stage** of the 6-12 month journey
- **Evidence-based** medical information (AHPRA compliant)
- **Action-oriented** (what to do, not just what to know)
- **SEO-optimized** for journey keywords

3. **Australian-specific** - Most content is US-focused
4. **Action-oriented** - Most is informational, not actionable
5. **Interactive tools** - Very few calculators, quizzes, trackers
6. **Evidence-based** - Heavy on opinion, light on research

### How to Dominate:

- **Be more authoritative** - Cite research, not opinions
- **Be more helpful** - Provide tools and downloads
- **Be more Australian** - Local pricing, Medicare, locations
