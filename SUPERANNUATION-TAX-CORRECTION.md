## Example Calculation (For User Understanding)

**Scenario:** 45-year-old withdrawing $20,000 for surgery

**Without tax disclosure (WRONG):**
- Withdrawal: $20,000
- Tax: $0 (incorrectly stated)
- Net amount: $20,000 ❌

**With accurate tax disclosure (CORRECT):**
- Withdrawal: $20,000
- Estimated tax (assuming all taxable): $4,400 (22%)
- Net amount: ~$15,600 ✅

**Impact:** Patient needs to withdraw ~$25,640 to net $20,000 after tax.
