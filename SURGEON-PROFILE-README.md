# Surgeon/Clinic Profile Implementation - Quick Start Guide

## üìö Documentation Overview

I've created three comprehensive documents to guide your surgeon profile implementation:

### 1. **SURGEON-PROFILE-STRATEGY.md** (Strategic Plan)
Your complete strategic blueprint covering:
- üìä Strategic overview and opportunity analysis
- üîç Data collection with Apify (Google Maps scraping)
- üìã CSV data structure (60+ fields defined)
- üèóÔ∏è Page architecture (9 sections per profile)
- üéØ SEO optimization strategy
- üí∞ Revenue projections ($40K-150K/month by month 12)

**Read this first** to understand the overall strategy and expected results.

### 2. **SURGEON-IMPLEMENTATION-WORKFLOW.md** (Execution Plan)
Step-by-step implementation guide with:
- üìÖ Week-by-week timeline
- üîß Detailed instructions for each phase
- üíª Specific Claude prompts for each step
- ‚úÖ Quality assurance checklists
- üìä Monitoring and optimization guidelines

**Use this as your day-to-day playbook** for execution.

### 3. **CLAUDE-PROMPTS.md** (Ready-to-Use Prompts)
12 copy-paste prompts for Claude including:
- Data enrichment scripts
- Component generation
- Page generation automation
- Schema markup creation
- Testing and deployment

**Copy these directly into Cursor** when you're ready to code.

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Data Collection (Day 1-2)

```bash
# 1. Set up Apify account
Go to: https://apify.com/epctex/google-maps-scraper

# 2. Run scraper with these search terms:
- "bariatric surgeon Sydney"
- "gastric sleeve surgeon Sydney"
- "bariatric surgeon Melbourne"
# (see SURGEON-IMPLEMENTATION-WORKFLOW.md for full list)

# 3. Download CSV
Save to: /data/raw/google-maps-surgeons-raw.csv
```

**Expected result:** 200-500 surgeon records

---

### Step 2: Data Processing (Day 3-5)

```bash
# 1. Clean data in Google Sheets
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize phone numbers
- Extract qualifications
- Categorize procedures

# 2. Use Claude prompts from CLAUDE-PROMPTS.md
Prompt 1: Enrich data
Prompt 2: Generate bios

# 3. Final CSV
Save to: /data/surgeons-master-final.csv
```

**Expected result:** Clean, enriched CSV ready for import

---

### Step 3: Code Generation (Day 6-10)

```bash
# Open Cursor and use Claude prompts in order:

Prompt 3: Create data access layer (src/data/surgeons.ts)
Prompt 4: Create surgeon components (src/components/surgeons/)
Prompt 5: Create dynamic route (src/pages/surgeons/[city]/[slug].astro)
Prompt 6-7: Create directory pages
Prompt 10: Generate all pages automatically

# Then deploy!
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

**Expected result:** 200+ surgeon profiles live on your site

---

## üí∞ Expected Results

### Month 1
- 200+ surgeon pages live
- 50-100 organic visitors/day
- 5-15 consultation bookings
- **$2.5K-7.5K revenue**

### Month 3
- 100+ surgeon keywords ranking top 10
- 200-400 organic visitors/day
- 20-50 bookings
- **$10K-25K/month revenue**

### Month 6
- 300+ surgeon keywords ranking top 5
- 500-1,000 visitors/day
- 80-150 bookings
- **$40K-75K/month revenue**

### Month 12
- Market leadership
- 1,000-2,000 visitors/day
- 150-300 bookings
- **$75K-150K/month revenue**

## üéØ Why This Works

### 1. Low Competition Keywords
- Most competitors don't have individual surgeon pages
- Easy to rank for "[surgeon name] [city]"
- Capture branded searches

### 2. High Intent Traffic
- Users searching for specific surgeons are ready to book
- **8-15% conversion rate** (vs 2-4% for general pages)
- Shorter decision cycle

### 3. Programmatic Scale
- Generate 200+ pages from one CSV
- Consistent quality across all profiles
- Easy to update and maintain

### 4. Trust Building
- Reviews build credibility
- Transparent pricing reduces friction
- Detailed profiles answer questions
