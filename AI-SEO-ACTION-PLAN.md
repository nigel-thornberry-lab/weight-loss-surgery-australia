```

**‚úÖ GOOD (AI SEO):**
```
What is gastric sleeve surgery?

Gastric sleeve surgery removes approximately 80% of your stomach,
leaving a banana-shaped "sleeve." This restricts food intake and
reduces hunger hormones, resulting in 60-70% excess weight loss
within 12-18 months.

Cost: $15,000-$25,000 in Australia
Recovery: 2-3 weeks
Best for: BMI 40+ or 35+ with health conditions
```

**2. Add "Answer in Meta Description"**

Update all your page meta descriptions to include direct answers:

**Current:** "Learn about gastric sleeve surgery, costs, and recovery times in Australia."

**Better:** "Gastric sleeve surgery costs $15,000-$25,000 in Australia. Expect 60-70% weight loss and 2-3 week recovery. Compare surgeons and get quotes."

#### Content Format (Update ALL Blog Posts)

**Add These Sections to EVERY Article:**

      <span class="badge">Expert Verified</span>
