Hi again,

One of the most common questions we hear: **"What does this journey actually look like?"**

Most websites skip straight to the success stories (we don't do that—AHPRA regulations exist for good reason). Instead, let's walk through the realistic timeline, including the parts that aren't glamorous.

### The Four Phases

**Phase 1: Decision & Preparation (1-6 months)**

This is where you are now. During this phase, most people:
- Research procedures and surgeons
- Attend 1-3 consultations
- Complete medical assessments (bloods, scans, psych evaluation)
- Work with a dietitian on pre-op preparation
- Navigate insurance approvals or arrange financing

**Common challenge**: Waiting can feel frustrating. The medical assessments exist to reduce surgical risk, but they add time to your timeline.

---

**Phase 2: Pre-Op Diet (2-4 weeks before surgery)**

You'll follow a specific diet to shrink your liver, which reduces the technical difficulty of surgery and may help lower the risk of certain complications. This typically involves:
- High-protein, low-carbohydrate meals
- Meal replacement shakes
- No alcohol
- Gradual portion reduction

**Common challenge**: This is often described as the hardest part psychologically. Many people use this phase to practice new eating habits.

---

**Phase 3: Surgery & Hospital Stay (1-3 days)**

- Surgery typically takes 1-2 hours
- Hospital stay is usually 1-2 nights (varies by procedure and surgeon)
- Initial recovery focuses on pain management and preventing complications
- You'll start on clear liquids immediately post-op

**Common challenge**: Anaesthesia side effects (nausea, drowsiness) and incision discomfort. Pain is usually managed effectively with medication.

**Important**: All surgery carries risks including infection, bleeding, and in rare cases, more serious complications. Your surgeon will discuss specific risks relevant to your health.

---

**Phase 4: Recovery & New Normal (lifelong)**

**Weeks 1-2**: Clear liquids only, limited activity, focus on hydration  
**Weeks 3-4**: Progress to full liquids, gradual return to light activity  
**Weeks 5-8**: Pureed foods, slowly building stamina  
**Weeks 9-12**: Soft foods, most people return to work  
**3-6 months**: Regular textured foods, establishing new habits  
**12+ months**: Ongoing weight loss typically stabilizes; focus shifts to maintenance

**Common challenge**: The dietary progression feels slow. Emotional adjustment takes longer than physical healing for most people. Weight loss is not linear—stalls are normal.

### The Part No One Talks About

This isn't a magic fix. Surgery changes your stomach, not your relationship with food or the life circumstances that may have contributed to weight gain.

Most people report:
- **Physical**: Reduced hunger, early fullness, need for vitamin supplementation (lifelong)
- **Emotional**: Relief mixed with grief, adjustment period, need for ongoing support
- **Practical**: Changed social dynamics around food, wardrobe replacement costs, potential for excess skin

Success requires:
- Regular follow-up with your surgical team
- Commitment to dietary guidelines
- Mental health support (highly recommended)
- Realistic expectations about outcomes
