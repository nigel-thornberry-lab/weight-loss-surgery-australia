# Live Site Review – Bariatric SurgeryHub

Reviewed: `https://bariatricsurgeryhub.com/surgeons`

## Summary
- Directory surfacing surgeons by suburb/city with procedure filters and strong navigation.
- Clear conversion paths (Cost Calculator, Book Consultation) and resource hub (FAQs, Guides).
- Baseline suitable for E‑E‑A‑T; opportunities to deepen surgeon-specific differentiation and structured data.

## Content Model Observed
- Listings by location with counts per suburb.
- Global navigation to Procedures, Surgeons, Costs & Compare, Locations, Resources, Guides, Blog.
- Repeated UX anchors (Cost Calculator, FAQs, Comparisons) throughout.

## Strengths
- Comprehensive IA; multiple patient journeys (cost-first, surgeon-first, education-first).
- Medical disclaimer and policy links present.
- Clear suburb landing options (e.g., Parramatta, Bondi, Box Hill, Ringwood).

## Gaps & Opportunities
- Surgeon profile uniqueness: reduce generic overlap; emphasize differentiators (techniques, research, teaching, languages, clinic setup).
- Rich media: ensure high-quality portraits and contextual images with descriptive alt text; consistent crops.
- Structured data: expand per-profile JSON-LD (`Physician`, `FAQPage`, `BreadcrumbList`).
- Outbound link policy: authoritative dofollow (AHPRA/hospitals/pro bodies/surgeon sites); nofollow/sponsored where applicable.
- Accessibility: verify contrast, heading hierarchy, focus states, link text clarity.
- Performance: image compression (≤200KB), responsive sizes, lazy-loading; aim LCP ≤ 2.5s on 4G.

## Critical Alignments for Profile Upgrades
- Above-the-fold Professional Highlights (3–5 surgeon-specific bullets).
- Surgeon-tailored FAQs (candidacy, risks, consult expectations, telehealth).
- Locations and access details (parking, transport) and consult modes.
- Compliance tone (no outcome promises), last reviewed date, transparent unknowns.

## Action Items (Mapped to Plan)
- 0) Live-site review: complete.
- 1) Baseline audit: per-surgeon audit docs to be created from queue.
- 2) Data consolidation: CSV-first, then authoritative sources.
- 7) Schema: implement/validate per profile.
- 8–9) Links + QA: apply policy, run checks.
