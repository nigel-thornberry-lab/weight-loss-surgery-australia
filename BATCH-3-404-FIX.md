# Batch 3 Pages - 404 Fix Complete ✅

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The 5 batch 3 suburb pages (Ryde, Randwick, Hornsby, Sutherland, Burwood) were returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause:** Pages were attempting to use `getCollection('surgeons')` from Astro's content collections, but no content collection was configured. This caused build errors and prevented the pages from being generated.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Changed Files:
1. `src/pages/locations/ryde.astro`
2. `src/pages/locations/randwick.astro`
3. `src/pages/locations/hornsby.astro`
4. `src/pages/locations/sutherland.astro`
5. `src/pages/locations/burwood.astro`

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed** invalid import: `import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';`
2. **Removed** surgeon filtering code that depended on the non-existent collection
3. **Removed** the "Expert Bariatric Surgeons" section from each page

### Result:
- ✅ All 5 pages now build successfully
- ✅ No errors or warnings specific to these pages
- ✅ Pages are now live and accessible

## 🔗 Live URLs (Now Working)

All pages are now accessible at:
- https://weight-loss-surgery-australia.vercel.app/locations/ryde ✅
- https://weight-loss-surgery-australia.vercel.app/locations/randwick ✅
- https://weight-loss-surgery-australia.vercel.app/locations/hornsby ✅
- https://weight-loss-surgery-australia.vercel.app/locations/sutherland ✅
- https://weight-loss-surgery-australia.vercel.app/locations/burwood ✅

## 📝 Note on Surgeons Section

The "Expert Bariatric Surgeons" section was removed from these 5 pages because:
1. No content collection exists for surgeons
2. Surgeon profiles already exist as individual `.astro` pages in `/src/pages/surgeons/`
3. The main `/surgeons` directory page already provides comprehensive surgeon listings

Users can still access surgeon profiles through:
- The main surgeons directory: `/surgeons`
- Direct links to individual surgeon pages
- Internal navigation from other pages

## ✅ Deployment

- **Commit:** `68e7a74` - "Fix batch 3 suburb pages - remove invalid surgeons collection code"
- **Status:** Pushed to GitHub & auto-deployed to Vercel
- **Build Status:** Successful ✅
- **All Pages Live:** Yes ✅
