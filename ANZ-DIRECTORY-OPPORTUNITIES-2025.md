## Implementation Roadmap

### Option A: Single Focus (Recommended)

**Launch: Dental Implants Directory**

**Why this first:**
- Highest revenue potential ($180-300K Year 1)
- Lowest competition
- Easiest to implement (proven with bariatric)
- Clearest cost transparency opportunity
- High search volume + low difficulty

**Timeline:**
- **Month 1-3:** Launch MVP, 50 listings, cost calculator
- **Month 4-6:** Scale to 200 listings, implement lead gen
- **Month 7-9:** Newsletter products, premium listings
- **Month 10-12:** Optimize and scale

**Expected Effort:**
- Full-time for first 6 months
- Part-time (20hrs/wk) after Month 6 with VA support

---

### Option B: Portfolio Approach

**Launch 2-3 directories simultaneously**

**Recommended combo:**
1. **Dental Implants** (highest revenue, easiest launch)
2. **Adult ADHD** (different audience, lower competition)
3. **Hold:** IVF/Fertility (launch Month 9 after validating model)

**Why this works:**
- Risk diversification
- Different audiences (no cannibalization)
- Shared infrastructure (CMS, call tracking, newsletter platform)
- Tim Stoddard did this (portfolio of directories)

**Timeline:**
- **Month 1-2:** Launch both directories (80/20 split of effort)
- **Month 3-6:** Scale primary (dental), maintain secondary
- **Month 7-9:** Add IVF if bandwidth allows
- **Month 10-12:** Optimize all three

**Expected Effort:**
- Full-time+ (50-60hrs/wk) for first 9 months
- Multiple VAs needed by Month 6

**Revenue Projection:**
- Year 1: $220,000-350,000 (combined)
- Year 2: $400,000-600,000 (compounding)

---

### Option C: Acquisition Target Research

**Instead of building, identify acquisition targets**

**Rationale:**
- You have proven ability to build/scale directories
- Buying existing traffic/revenue = faster ROI
- Can apply your cost transparency model to existing sites

**Targets to research:**
- Existing dental directories with traffic but poor monetization
- IVF forums/communities (could add directory)
- Struggling health directories (buy, pivot, scale)

**Investment range:** $20,000-150,000

## Risk Analysis

### Macro Risks (Apply to All)

**1. AI Disruption**
- **Risk Level:** Low-Medium
- **Reasoning:** Local transactional searches AI-resistant (Tim's key insight)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on bottom-funnel keywords, own email list, build brand

**2. Recession Sensitivity**
- **Risk Level:** Medium-High (varies by niche)
- **Impact by niche:**
  - Dental implants: HIGH (discretionary)
  - IVF: MEDIUM (people delay but don't cancel)
  - ADHD: LOW (need-based, productivity-driven)
  - Rehab: LOW (need-based, recession-resistant)
  - Plastic surgery: HIGH (discretionary)
- **Mitigation:** Portfolio approach spreads risk

**3. Regulatory Changes**
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** AHPRA guidelines could tighten on advertising
- **Mitigation:** Stay compliant, focus on education not endorsement, medical advisory board

### Micro Risks (Niche-Specific)

**Dental Implants:**
- ❌ Dentists refuse to share pricing → Start with ranges, offer anonymized data
- ❌ Dental associations push back → Position as patient education, not advertising

**IVF/Fertility:**
- ❌ Sensitive emotional content → Hire medical reviewer, compassionate tone
- ❌ Success rate data access → Use government data (publicly available)

**Adult ADHD:**
- ❌ Lower search volume → Compensate with higher conversion rate, community building
- ❌ Practitioner privacy concerns → Allow opt-out, aggregate wait time data

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)

**Step 1: Decision Point**
- Choose: Single focus OR portfolio approach
- **Recommendation:** Start with dental implants (highest upside, lowest risk)

**Step 2: Domain & Infrastructure**
- Register domain: `dentalimplantshub.com.au` (or similar)
- Set up WordPress + Elementor
- Install call tracking (Delacon trial)

**Step 3: Initial Research**
- List 100 dental implant providers across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane
- Call 20 clinics for pricing (validate assumption)
- Document what information they're willing to share

**Step 4: Lead Buyer Outreach**
- Research 5 dental marketing agencies in Australia
- Draft partnership email
- Send outreach to validate demand for leads

**Validation Criteria (Go/No-Go):**
- ✅ Can you get pricing from 30%+ of dentists? (GO)
- ✅ Do marketing agencies want to buy leads? (GO)
- ✅ Is pricing variation significant enough to be valuable? (GO)
- ❌ All three fail? (NO-GO - try ADHD or IVF instead)
