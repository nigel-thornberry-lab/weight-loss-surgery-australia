## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can we send these emails faster (e.g., every 2 days)?"
**Answer**: You can, but 3-4 day intervals allow for processing time and reduce unsubscribes. Test data will tell you optimal frequency.

### "Should we send at specific times of day?"
**Answer**: Generally, 9-11am or 1-3pm AEST/AEDT perform well for Australian audiences. A/B test to find your optimal time.

### "What if someone books a consultation mid-sequence?"
**Answer**: Ideally, tag them as "consulted" and either:
1. Continue sequence (reinforces decision)
2. Move to "post-consultation" sequence (different content)
3. Remove from automation (stop emailing)

Test which approach works best for your audience.

### "Can we repurpose these as blog content?"
**Answer**: Yes! Each email can become a blog post with minimal adaptation. This adds SEO value and allows organic discovery.

### "Should we create different sequences for different procedures?"
**Answer**: Phase 2 enhancement. Start with this general sequence, then create procedure-specific variants once you have baseline data.
