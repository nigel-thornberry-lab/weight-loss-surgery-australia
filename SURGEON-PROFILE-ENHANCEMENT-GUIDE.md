---

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Clean Your CSV Data

**Your CSV should include these columns:**
- `business_name` - Practice name
- `surgeon_name` - Individual surgeon name (if available)
- `city` - City location
- `state` - State (NSW, VIC, etc.)
- `google_maps_url` - Full Google Maps URL (REQUIRED for scraping)
- `website` - Surgeon's website URL (REQUIRED for scraping)
- Any other existing data you want to keep

**Example CSV structure:**
```csv
business_name,surgeon_name,city,state,google_maps_url,website
"Dr. Andrew Huo",Andrew Huo,Richmond,VIC,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...,http://www.melbourneweightloss.com.au/
"Bariatrics Melbourne",Andrew Packiyanathan,Melbourne,VIC,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...,http://bariatricsmelbourne.com.au/
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run this command to install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs:
- `puppeteer` - For browser automation
- `cheerio` - For HTML parsing
- `axios` - For HTTP requests
- `csv-parser` & `csv-writer` - For CSV processing

### Step 3: Run the Scraper

```bash
npm run scrape:surgeons surgeons-cleaned.csv surgeons-enriched-full.csv
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads your cleaned CSV
2. For each surgeon:
   - Opens Google Maps page
   - Extracts reviews (up to 10 per surgeon)
   - Extracts operating hours
   - Extracts photos
   - Opens their website
   - Extracts procedures offered
   - Extracts professional memberships
   - Extracts pricing information
   - Finds surgeon photos
3. Saves all enriched data to new CSV

**Expected runtime:** 2-5 seconds per surgeon
- 100 surgeons = ~5-10 minutes
- 400 surgeons = ~20-40 minutes

### Step 4: Review Enriched Data

The output CSV will include NEW columns:
- `surgeon_photo` - URL to surgeon's photo
- `operating_hours` - JSON object with hours {"Monday": "9:00 AM - 5:00 PM", ...}
- `professional_memberships` - Comma-separated (FRACS, RACS, ANZBS, etc.)
- `pricing_range` - Extracted pricing (e.g., "$15,000 - $25,000")
- `real_reviews` - JSON array of real Google reviews
- `practice_photos` - JSON array of practice/office photos

### Step 5: Generate Profile Pages

After enrichment, generate the profile pages:

```bash
npm run generate:pages
```

This will create individual surgeon pages in `/src/pages/surgeons/[city]/[surgeon-slug].astro`

## üîß Customization Options

### Adjust Scraping Limits

Edit `scripts/scrape-surgeon-data.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  DELAY_BETWEEN_SURGEONS: 2000,  // Time between surgeons (ms)
  DELAY_BETWEEN_PAGES: 1000,     // Time between pages (ms)
  MAX_REVIEWS_PER_SURGEON: 10,   // Number of reviews to scrape
  HEADLESS: true,                // Run browser in background
  TIMEOUT: 30000,                // Page load timeout (ms)
};
```

### Add More Data Sources

You can extend the scraper to include:
- RateMDs reviews
- HealthEngine reviews
- LinkedIn profiles
- Medical directory listings

---

## üö® Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- The scraper includes delays to avoid rate limiting
- Google Maps: 2 seconds between requests
- Websites: 1 second between pages
- Do NOT reduce these delays or you may get blocked

### Legal Considerations
- ‚úÖ Scraping publicly available data (reviews, hours) is legal
- ‚úÖ Linking to Google Maps is allowed
- ‚úÖ Displaying reviews with attribution is fair use
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always respect robots.txt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't scrape private/gated content

### Data Quality
- Not all surgeons will have complete data
- Some websites may not list procedures explicitly
- Pricing is often not public
- Photos may not always be available

---

## üìù CSV Data Validation

### Before Running Scraper:

**Required Fields:**
- ‚úÖ `google_maps_url` must be valid Google Maps URL
- ‚úÖ `website` must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URL
- ‚úÖ `city` and `state` must be present

**Recommended Fields:**
- `surgeon_name` (helps with photo detection)
- `business_name` (fallback for surgeon_name)
- `phone` (backup if not scraped)
- `rating` (from initial data collection)

### Data Cleaning Tips:

1. **Google Maps URLs:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Good: https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...
   ‚úÖ Good: https://maps.google.com/?cid=123456789
   ‚ùå Bad: maps.google.com (missing https://)
   ‚ùå Bad: Just the business name
   ```

2. **Website URLs:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Good: https://www.example.com
   ‚úÖ Good: http://example.com.au
   ‚ùå Bad: www.example.com (missing http)
   ‚ùå Bad: example (incomplete URL)
   ```

3. **Remove duplicates** based on:
   - Same Google Maps Place ID
   - Same website URL
   - Same phone number + city
