## 🔗 Integration with Your Website

### Option 1: Create API Endpoint (Recommended)

Create `/src/pages/api/drip/subscribe.ts` in your Astro project:

```typescript
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';
import { DripClient } from '../../../drip-mcp-server/src/drip-client.js';

const client = new DripClient(
  import.meta.env.DRIP_API_TOKEN,
  import.meta.env.DRIP_ACCOUNT_ID
);

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request }) => {
  const { email, firstName, tag, customFields } = await request.json();

  try {
    const result = await client.createOrUpdateSubscriber({
      email,
      first_name: firstName,
      tags: [tag],
      custom_fields: customFields || {}
    });

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true, data: result }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: false, error: error.message }), {
      status: 500,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Frontend Integration

```javascript
// In your cost calculator component
async function submitToDrip(formData) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/drip/subscribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: formData.email,
      firstName: formData.firstName,
      tag: 'calculator_user',
      customFields: {
        estimated_cost: formData.calculatedCost,
        calculator_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
        procedure_interest: formData.procedure,
        location: formData.location,
        bmi: formData.bmi
      }
    })
  });

  return await response.json();
}
```
