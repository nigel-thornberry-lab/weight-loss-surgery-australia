## Email Body

Hi,

By now, you've learned about the timeline, costs, mental preparation, and how to choose a surgeon.

But you probably still have specific questions. These are the ones we hear most often—and the honest answers.

---

## About Recovery and Lifestyle

### "How long until I can exercise again?"

**Short answer**: Light walking immediately; return to gym at 4-6 weeks depending on your surgeon's protocol and procedure.

**Longer answer**:
- Days 1-7: Gentle walking only (helps prevent blood clots)
- Weeks 2-4: Light cardio (walking, stationary bike)
- Weeks 4-6: Gradual return to strength training (avoid heavy lifting)
- Months 2-3: Back to full exercise routine for most people

**Important**: Always follow your surgeon's specific guidelines—they vary based on your procedure and individual healing.

---

### "Can I drink alcohol after surgery?"

**Short answer**: Not for at least 3-6 months, and then in moderation only.

**Longer answer**:
- Alcohol is absorbed much faster post-surgery (smaller stomach, altered absorption)
- You'll feel the effects more quickly and intensely
- Higher risk of transfer addiction (replacing food with alcohol)
- Empty calories that work against weight loss goals
- Some people develop alcohol intolerance or sensitivity

**Clinical concern**: Studies show increased risk of alcohol use disorder after bariatric surgery in some patients, particularly those with previous substance use history. This risk typically emerges 1-2 years post-surgery.

---

### "Will I lose my hair?"

**Short answer**: Temporary hair thinning is common (months 3-6 post-op), but it grows back.

**Longer answer**:
- Occurs in 30-50% of patients
- Caused by rapid weight loss, caloric restriction, and stress on the body
- Usually temporary—hair regrows within 6-12 months
- Can be minimized with adequate protein intake and vitamin supplementation
- Biotin supplements may help (discuss with your surgical team)

**Reality check**: This concerns people more than they expect, but it's temporary for the vast majority.

---

### "What medications can I take after surgery?"

**Short answer**: Most medications are fine, but some need to be adjusted.

**Longer answer**:
**Can usually take:**
- Paracetamol (first-line pain relief)
- Most prescription medications (adjusted for absorption)
- Vitamin supplements (mandatory)

**Avoid or use with caution:**
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin)—increased risk of ulcers or stomach irritation
- Extended-release medications—may not be absorbed properly
- Large pills—may need to be crushed or switched to liquid

**Critical**: Tell your surgeon and GP about ALL medications and supplements you take. Some will need to be adjusted or changed before surgery.

---

### "Can I get pregnant after weight loss surgery?"

**Short answer**: Yes, but you should wait 12-18 months post-surgery.

**Longer answer**:
- Fertility often improves significantly after weight loss
- Pregnancy is generally safer at a healthier weight
- However, rapid weight loss and nutritional demands during the first year make it risky for baby's development
- Birth control is essential during the first 12-18 months
- Close monitoring by your bariatric team and obstetrician is necessary when you do become pregnant
- Oral contraceptives may be less effective immediately post-surgery (absorption issues)—discuss alternatives with your doctor

**Important**: Plan pregnancies with your healthcare team. Vitamin supplementation is critical during pregnancy after bariatric surgery.

## About the Procedure

### "Can weight loss surgery be reversed?"

**Short answer**: Gastric band can be removed; sleeve and bypass are generally permanent.

**Longer answer**:

**Gastric band**: Can be removed, stomach returns to normal size over time. However, removal doesn't guarantee return to pre-surgery weight.

**Gastric sleeve**: Permanent—approximately 75-85% of stomach is removed and cannot be reattached. Can be revised to bypass if needed.

**Gastric bypass**: Technically reversible but rarely done due to complexity and risks. Consider this permanent.

**Reality**: Most people don't regret surgery to the point of wanting reversal. The more common issue is wanting revision for complications or inadequate weight loss.

---

### "What if I don't lose enough weight?"

**Short answer**: Weight loss varies by individual; "failure" is uncommon but does happen.

**Longer answer**:
- Expected weight loss varies by procedure:
  - **Gastric sleeve**: 50-70% of excess weight
  - **Gastric bypass**: 60-80% of excess weight
  - **Gastric band**: 40-50% of excess weight
- Some people lose more, some less
- Factors affecting outcomes: adherence to dietary guidelines, exercise, underlying metabolic conditions, procedure type, initial BMI
- If weight loss plateaus early or regain occurs, revision surgery is sometimes an option
- "Failure" (defined as <50% excess weight loss) occurs in roughly 10-20% of cases depending on the procedure

**Important**: Weight loss surgery is a tool, not a guarantee. Long-term success requires ongoing lifestyle changes.

---

### "Will I have excess skin?"

**Short answer**: Possibly, especially if you lose a significant amount of weight.

**Longer answer**:
- More likely if: you're older, lose 50+ kg, have been overweight for many years, have poor skin elasticity
- Less likely if: you're younger, build muscle during weight loss, lose weight gradually
- Problem areas: abdomen, arms, thighs, breasts
- Exercise and hydration help somewhat, but don't prevent it entirely
- Surgical removal (abdominoplasty, brachioplasty, etc.) is an option but expensive ($8,000-$20,000+ per area)

**Reality**: Many people find they'd rather have excess skin than excess weight. Others find it distressing. There's no right answer—it's personal.

---

### "What happens if I eat the 'wrong' foods?"

**Short answer**: You'll likely feel sick—and that's by design.

**Longer answer**:

**Gastric sleeve/bypass**: Eating too much, too fast, or foods high in sugar can cause:
- **Dumping syndrome** (bypass mainly): nausea, sweating, diarrhea, dizziness
- **Nausea and vomiting**: From overeating or eating too fast
- **Discomfort**: Foods that don't sit well (varies by person)

**Gastric band**: Eating too fast or not chewing thoroughly can cause food to get stuck, leading to vomiting.

**Over time**: Some people find they can "eat around" the surgery (grazing, high-calorie liquids, slider foods). This can lead to weight regain.

**The point**: Your body will give you feedback. Listen to it.

## About Costs and Practicalities

### "Can I claim this on Medicare?"

**Short answer**: Yes, if you meet eligibility criteria and your surgeon uses MBS item numbers.

**Longer answer**:
- Medicare rebates available for eligible procedures: ~$1,400-$1,800
- Eligibility: BMI ≥35 with obesity-related comorbidity, or BMI ≥40
- Doesn't cover full cost—typically reduces out-of-pocket by $1,400-$1,800
- Must be performed by a qualified surgeon in a licensed facility
- Some surgeons don't use MBS item numbers (means no Medicare rebate)—ask upfront

---

### "How much time off work will I need?"

**Short answer**: Most people take 2-4 weeks, but it varies by job type.

**Longer answer**:
- Desk job: 1-2 weeks common
- Physical labor: 4-6 weeks or longer
- Self-employed: Plan for at least 2 weeks minimum
- Depends on: your procedure, individual recovery, energy levels, complication risk

**Tip**: Plan for more time than you think. Coming back too early can delay healing.

---

## About Long-Term Life

### "Will I need to take vitamins forever?"

**Short answer**: Yes.

**Longer answer**:
- Lifelong vitamin and mineral supplementation is mandatory after gastric sleeve and bypass
- Typically includes: multivitamin, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron (especially for menstruating women)
- Blood tests at regular intervals (6 months, 12 months, then annually) to check levels
- Cost: ~$30-$80/month
- Skip them at your peril—deficiencies can cause serious health problems (anemia, osteoporosis, neurological issues)

**Non-negotiable**: This is part of the deal. Factor it into your lifetime commitment.

---

### "What's the biggest thing people regret not knowing beforehand?"

**Short answer**: How much mental and emotional work is required.

**Common surprises people report**:
- How difficult the dietary progression is (especially the liquid stages)
- How much your relationship with food was emotional, not just physical
- How friends and family react (not always supportively)
- How long it takes to "feel normal" again (6-12 months)
- That weight loss slows down and stalls—it's not linear
- That some foods you loved might make you feel sick forever
- That you can regain weight if you don't stay vigilant

**The theme**: Most people underestimate the lifestyle change and overestimate how "fixed" they'll feel.
