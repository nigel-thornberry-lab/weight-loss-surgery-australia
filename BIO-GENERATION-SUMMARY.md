---
// src/pages/surgeons/[slug].astro
import { getSurgeonBySlug } from '../../utils/surgeonData';

const surgeon = await getSurgeonBySlug(Astro.params.slug);
---

<Layout 
  title={surgeon.meta_title}
  description={surgeon.meta_description}
>
  <article class="surgeon-profile">
    <!-- Hero Section -->
    <header>
      <h1>{surgeon.surgeon_name || surgeon.business_name}</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">{surgeon.location_display}</p>
      <div class="rating">
        ‚≠ê {surgeon.rating} ({surgeon.review_count} reviews)
      </div>
    </header>

    <!-- Biography -->
    <section class="bio">

// Convert **text** to <strong>text</strong>
function formatBio(bioText: string): string {
  return bioText
    .replace(/\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g, '<strong>$1</strong>')
    .replace(/\n\n/g, '</p><p>')
    .replace(/^/, '<p>')
    .replace(/$/, '</p>');
}
```

### Example Profile Page Usage

```astro
---
const formattedBio = formatBio(surgeon.bio_long);
