## CONTENT DIFFERENTIATION

### What Exists:
- Recovery article covers diet briefly in context of timeline
- Recipes article provides specific recipes
- Procedure page mentions diet stages (200 words)

### THIS Article Is Different:
✅ **Comprehensive diet education** - WHY each stage exists (medical reasons)  
✅ **Detailed food lists** - Approved foods, foods to avoid (each stage)  
✅ **Portion size guide** - Visual comparisons  
✅ **Meal timing** - When to eat, how often  
✅ **Troubleshooting** - Common problems each stage, solutions  
✅ **Transition criteria** - How to know you're ready for next stage  
✅ **Sample meal plans** - 7-day plan for each stage  
✅ **Nutrition targets** - Protein, calories, vitamins by stage

**Zero overlap:** This is WHAT/WHY/HOW to eat. Recipes article is specific recipes. Recovery article is when/timeline.

## ARTICLE STRUCTURE

### H1: Gastric Sleeve Diet Stages: Your Complete 4-Phase Progression Guide

**Opening (150 words):**
- Diet progression is the most critical part of gastric sleeve recovery
- Moving through stages too quickly = complications
- Moving too slowly = nutritional deficiencies
- This guide explains each stage: Duration, foods, portions, tips
- Based on OSSANZ nutritional guidelines

---

### H2: Why Diet Stages Exist (The Science)

**Explanation (200 words):**

**Medical reasons for progressive diet:**
- ✅ Allow stomach to heal (sutures need 6-8 weeks)
- ✅ Prevent complications (leaks, strictures, blockages)
- ✅ Learn new eating habits gradually
- ✅ Prevent nausea and vomiting
- ✅ Ensure adequate nutrition at each phase

**What happens if you skip stages:**
- ❌ Risk of staple line leak (medical emergency)
- ❌ Severe nausea and vomiting
- ❌ Stomach distension (stretching new stomach)
- ❌ Blockage requiring medical intervention
- ❌ Nutritional deficiencies

**Important:** Always follow YOUR surgeon's specific timeline (may vary slightly from this guide)

---

### H2: Overview of All 4 Stages

**Quick visual:**

```
STAGE 1: Clear Liquids (Days 1-7)
Purpose: Hydration, gentle healing
Examples: Water, broth, sugar-free jelly
Portion: 30ml sips

STAGE 2: Full Liquids (Weeks 2-3)
Purpose: Protein introduction
Examples: Protein shakes, smooth soups
Portion: 60-120ml per "meal"
Protein target: 60-80g daily

STAGE 3: Pureed Foods (Weeks 4-6)
Purpose: Solid nutrition, blended
Examples: Pureed chicken, mashed vegetables
Portion: 2-4 tablespoons per meal
Protein target: 60-80g daily

STAGE 4: Soft Foods (Weeks 6-8)
Purpose: Transition to regular eating
Examples: Scrambled eggs, soft fish, ground meat
Portion: 1/4 - 1/2 cup per meal
Protein target: 60-80g daily

STAGE 5: Regular Foods (Week 8+)

Protein target: 60-100g daily
```

| 7:30am | Warm chicken broth | 30ml |
| 8:00am | Water | 30ml |
| 8:30am | Sugar-free jelly | 2 tbsp |
| 9:00am | Water | 30ml |
| ... | Continue pattern | ... |
| Goal | 1-1.5L total daily | Sip by sip |

#### H3: Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Can't drink enough
**Solution:** Set phone timer every 15 min, sip even if not thirsty

**Challenge:** Nausea when drinking
**Solution:** Try ice-cold or room temp (different temperatures), sip slower

**Challenge:** Bored with flavors
**Solution:** Try different broths, herbal teas, sugar-free jellyvarieties

#### H3: Signs You're Ready for Stage 2
✅ Tolerating 1L+ fluids daily without nausea
✅ No vomiting
✅ Day 7+ post-surgery
✅ Surgeon approval

### H2: Frequently Asked Questions

**Schema.org FAQ markup required**

#### **Q: How long is each gastric sleeve diet stage?**
**A:** Stage 1 (Clear Liquids): Days 1-7. Stage 2 (Full Liquids): Weeks 2-3. Stage 3 (Pureed): Weeks 4-6. Stage 4 (Soft Foods): Weeks 6-8. Stage 5 (Regular Foods): Week 8+ (lifelong). Always follow YOUR surgeon's specific timeline.

#### **Q: Can I skip a diet stage after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** No, never skip diet stages. Each stage allows your stomach to heal progressively and prevents serious complications like staple line leaks. Moving too quickly risks nausea, vomiting, pain, and medical emergencies. Always follow your surgeon's progression timeline exactly.

#### **Q: What happens if I eat solid food too soon after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Eating solid food before your stomach is healed can cause: Staple line leak (medical emergency), severe nausea/vomiting, stomach distension, blockage, or malnutrition. Always wait for surgeon's approval before progressing to the next diet stage.

#### **Q: How much protein do I need after gastric sleeve surgery?**
**A:** Most gastric sleeve patients need 60-80g protein daily during recovery (Weeks 2-8) and 60-100g daily long-term. Protein requirements vary based on weight, activity level, and individual needs. Prioritize protein at every meal.

#### **Q: When can I eat bread and pasta after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Most surgeons allow small amounts of whole grain bread and pasta starting Week 8+, but these should be eaten sparingly (fills stomach quickly with low nutrition). Always eat protein first, then vegetables, then small amounts of whole grains if you have room. Many patients choose to avoid these long-term.

#### **Q: What foods can I never eat again after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Permanently avoid or strictly limit: Carbonated drinks (stretches stomach), high-sugar foods (dumping syndrome risk), tough/dry meats, and high-fat fried foods. Individual tolerance varies—some foods may never sit well with you. Listen to your body.

#### **Q: How do I know if I'm ready for the next diet stage?**
**A:** You're ready for the next stage if: (1) Tolerating current stage foods without nausea, (2) Hitting protein targets consistently, (3) Passed surgeon's recommended timeline, (4) Received surgeon clearance at follow-up. Never progress without meeting ALL criteria.

#### **Q: What is dumping syndrome and how do I avoid it?**
**A:** Dumping syndrome occurs when high-sugar foods move too quickly from stomach to intestines, causing: Nausea, diarrhea, sweating, rapid heartbeat, dizziness. Avoid it by: No high-sugar foods, no sugary drinks, eat slowly, protein-first eating. Affects some gastric sleeve patients.
