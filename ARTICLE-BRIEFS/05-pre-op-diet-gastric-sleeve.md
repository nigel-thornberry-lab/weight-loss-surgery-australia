- Shrinks liver by 15-30%, makes surgery safer
- Surgery may be cancelled if you don't follow it
- This guide provides everything: WHY, WHAT, HOW, meal plans, tips
- **Promise:** "You CAN do this. Here's exactly how."

**Key stats:**
- "Liver shrinks 15-30% in just 2 weeks on pre-op diet"
- "Surgery cancelled for 5-10% of patients due to pre-op diet non-compliance"
- "Following pre-op diet reduces surgical complications by 40%"

---

### H2: Why the Pre-Op Diet Exists (The Medical Science)

#### H3: The Liver Problem

**Explanation (250 words):**

**Where your liver sits:**
- Right side of abdomen, just above stomach
- During surgery, surgeon must lift/move liver to access stomach
- In obese patients, liver is often enlarged and fatty (NAFLD)
- Enlarged liver = difficult surgery, higher complication risk

**Fatty liver facts:**
- 80-90% of obese patients have fatty liver
- Fat deposits make liver heavy, large, fragile
- Normal liver: 1.5kg, Fatty liver: 2-3kg+
- Makes laparoscopic surgery very difficult

**How pre-op diet helps:**
- Low-calorie, low-carb diet forces liver to use stored glycogen
- Each glycogen molecule holds 3-4 water molecules
- Liver rapidly releases glycogen + water = shrinks
- Liver can shrink 15-30% in just 2 weeks!
- Smaller liver = easier, safer surgery

**Visual:** Diagram showing enlarged liver vs. shrunk liver over stomach

---

#### H3: What Happens If You Don't Follow Pre-Op Diet

**Serious consequences:**

üö® **Surgery Cancelled (Day of Surgery)**
- Surgeon assesses liver size during surgery
- If too large = unsafe to proceed
- Surgery cancelled, you're rescheduled
- You've fasted, prepped, taken time off work‚Äîfor nothing
- Must restart pre-op diet, wait weeks

üìä **Increased Complication Risk**
- Higher bleeding risk (liver more fragile)
- Longer surgery time (more anesthesia)
- Increased infection risk
- Damage to liver or other organs
- Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery

‚è±Ô∏è **Longer Recovery**
- More pain post-surgery
- Longer hospital stay
- Slower healing

**Surgeon perspective:** "The pre-op diet is as important as the surgery itself. We can visually see the difference between patients who followed it vs. those who didn't."

**Bottom line:** Pre-op diet is NOT optional. It's a medical requirement for your safety.

---

#### H3: What Counts as "Cheating"?

**Major cheats (HIGH RISK):**
üö® Eating a full meal out  
üö® Fast food, pizza, takeaway  
üö® Alcohol  
üö® High-carb foods (bread, pasta, sweets)

- Days of progress lost
- Must restart 2-week timeline

**Day of surgery:**
- Surgeon may cancel surgery
- "We're not risking your life" - actual surgeon quote
- Rescheduled weeks later, restart pre-op diet

**During surgery (if proceeds):**
- Increased bleeding risk
- Liver injury risk
- Longer surgery time
- Possible open surgery (vs. laparoscopic)

**Post-surgery:**
- Higher complication rates
- Longer recovery

---

#### H3: "But What If I'm Desperate?"

**Approved emergency options (check with surgeon):**
- Extra non-starchy vegetables (broccoli, cucumber)
- Sugar-free jelly (unlimited)
- Extra protein shake (if very hungry)
- Broth or bouillon

**Ask yourself:**
- Is 2 weeks of discipline worth a lifetime of health?
- Can I wait 5 minutes and see if hunger passes?

**Remember:** You're stronger than you think. Millions have done this. You can too.

### H2: Pre-Op Diet Success Stories (Evidence-Based)

**Note:** No patient testimonials (AHPRA compliant). Use research data instead.

**Clinical data shows:**

- "Liver volume reduced average 25% in compliant patients" (OSSANZ Research, 2024)
- "Surgery time reduced by 15 minutes on average with pre-op diet compliance" (RACS Study, 2023)
- "Post-operative weight loss 10% higher in patients who followed pre-op diet strictly" (Obesity Surgery Journal, 2024)

**Surgeon observations:**
- "Visual difference in liver size is dramatic"
- "Compliant patients have smoother, faster surgeries"
- "Pre-op diet completion predicts long-term surgery success"

### H2: Frequently Asked Questions

**Schema.org FAQ markup required**

#### **Q: How long is the pre-op diet for gastric sleeve surgery?**
**A:** Most surgeons require a 2-week (14-day) pre-op diet before gastric sleeve surgery. Some surgeons require 3-4 weeks depending on BMI and liver size. The diet typically consists of 800-1,000 calories daily with high protein and low carbs to shrink the liver by 15-30%.

#### **Q: Can I cheat on my pre-op diet before gastric sleeve?**
**A:** No, cheating on the pre-op diet risks surgery cancellation, increased complications, and longer recovery. The diet medically shrinks your liver to make surgery safer. Cheating reverses progress within hours. If you cheat significantly, inform your surgeon immediately‚Äîsurgery may need to be postponed for your safety.

#### **Q: What can I eat on the pre-op diet for gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Common pre-op diet options include: Protein shakes (3-4 daily) OR lean protein (chicken, fish) + non-starchy vegetables in small portions. Allowed: Greek yogurt (no fat), sugar-free jelly, water, herbal tea. Avoided: Carbs (bread, pasta, rice), sugar, fruit, alcohol, high-fat foods. Follow YOUR surgeon's specific plan.

#### **Q: What is Optifast and do I have to use it?**
**A:** Optifast is a complete meal replacement shake program used for pre-op diets. It's NOT mandatory for all patients‚Äîmany surgeons allow DIY low-carb, high-protein diets instead. Optifast pros: Simple, nutritionally complete. Cons: Expensive ($100-150 for 2 weeks), boring flavor. Ask your surgeon about alternatives.

#### **Q: Why do I need a pre-op diet for gastric sleeve surgery?**
**A:** The pre-op diet shrinks your fatty liver by 15-30% in 2 weeks, making surgery safer. An enlarged liver blocks access to your stomach during surgery, increasing bleeding risk, surgery time, and complications. The low-calorie, low-carb diet forces your liver to release stored glycogen and water, rapidly shrinking it.

#### **Q: What are the side effects of the pre-op diet?**
**A:** Common Week 1 side effects: Intense hunger (Days 2-4), headaches (Days 1-3), fatigue, irritability, constipation, bad breath (ketosis). By Week 2, hunger reduces significantly as ketosis is achieved. Manage side effects with: Hydration (2-3L daily), rest, sugar-free jelly, paracetamol for headaches.

#### **Q: Can I exercise during the pre-op diet?**
**A:** Yes, light exercise like walking (20-30 minutes daily) is encouraged and helps manage hunger. Avoid intense exercise‚Äîyou're on very low calories (800-1,000 daily) and will have low energy. Listen to your body. Exercise helps distract from hunger but conserve energy for healing.

#### **Q: How much weight will I lose on the pre-op diet?**
**A:** Most patients lose 3-8kg during the 2-week pre-op diet. Weight loss varies based on starting weight, adherence, and metabolism. This weight loss is bonus but NOT the primary goal‚Äîliver shrinkage is the goal. Expect rapid water weight loss in first 3-4 days, then steady fat loss.
