### H2: Frequently Asked Questions

**Schema.org FAQ markup required**

#### **Q: Can I have normal food after bariatric surgery?**
**A:** Yes, but in much smaller portions and with modifications. By Week 8+, most patients can eat regular foods, focusing on protein-first eating and avoiding high-sugar, high-fat foods. Portions remain small (1/2 - 1 cup per meal) permanently.

#### **Q: How much protein do I need after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Most bariatric patients need 60-100g protein daily. In early stages (Weeks 2-8), aim for 60-80g. Long-term, target 60-100g depending on your weight, activity level, and surgeon's recommendations.

#### **Q: What can I eat in the first week after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** First week (Days 1-7) is clear liquids only: water, clear broth, sugar-free jelly, diluted juice. Sip slowly (30ml at a time) and aim for 1-1.5L fluids daily. Protein introduction begins Week 2.

#### **Q: Can I use a meal replacement shake after bariatric surgery?**
**A:** Yes, protein shakes are essential in Weeks 2-3 and remain useful long-term for meeting protein targets. Choose shakes with 20-30g protein, low sugar (<5g), and no carbonation. Popular brands: Optifast, Optimum Nutrition, Bulk Nutrients.

#### **Q: When can I eat solid food after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Soft foods begin Week 6-8, and regular foods begin Week 8+ (surgeon-dependent). Never rush diet progression—your stomach needs time to heal. Follow your surgeon's timeline exactly.

#### **Q: What foods should I avoid after bariatric surgery?**
**A:** Permanently avoid or limit: High-sugar foods (risk of dumping syndrome), carbonated drinks (stretches stomach), tough red meat (hard to digest), bread/pasta/rice (low nutrition, fills quickly), and high-fat fried foods. Focus on lean proteins and vegetables.
