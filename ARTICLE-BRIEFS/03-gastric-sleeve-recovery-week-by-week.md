### H2: Frequently Asked Questions

**Schema.org FAQ markup required**

#### **Q: How long does gastric sleeve recovery take?**
**A:** Most gastric sleeve patients return to light activities in 1-2 weeks, full activities in 6-8 weeks. Complete healing takes 6 weeks, though you'll feel significantly better by Week 4. Timeline varies by individual, job type, and adherence to post-op guidelines.

#### **Q: What is the hardest week after gastric sleeve surgery?**
**A:** Week 1 is the hardest, particularly Days 2-4. Pain is highest, energy is lowest, and you're learning to manage your new stomach. Most patients report significant improvement by Day 7 and feel they've "turned a corner" by Week 2.

#### **Q: When can I return to work after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Desk jobs: 2-3 weeks. Physical jobs: 4-6 weeks. It depends on your job's physical demands, your recovery speed, and surgeon's clearance. Many patients return part-time at Week 2 before resuming full-time by Week 3-4.

#### **Q: How much weight will I lose in the first month after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Most patients lose 8-15kg in the first month after gastric sleeve surgery. Loss is fastest in Week 1 (water weight), then 1-2kg per week through Month 1. Individual results vary based on starting weight, adherence to diet, and activity level.

#### **Q: Is it normal to feel exhausted after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Yes, extreme fatigue is normal for Weeks 1-6 after gastric sleeve. Your body is healing from major surgery while consuming very few calories. Energy improves significantly by Week 4 and returns to near-normal by Week 6-8. Protein intake, hydration, and gentle walking help.

#### **Q: When can I exercise after gastric sleeve surgery?**
**A:** Walking can begin Day 1 post-surgery. Light cardio (cycling, elliptical) can begin Week 4. Full exercise including weights can begin Week 6-8 with surgeon clearance. Always start gradually and increase intensity slowly over 3 months.

#### **Q: What are signs of complications after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Warning signs include: Persistent vomiting, severe pain not controlled by medication, fever over 38°C, incision redness/swelling/discharge, dark urine or no urination for 8+ hours, chest pain, or difficulty breathing. Contact your surgeon immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.

#### **Q: How long until I can eat normal food after gastric sleeve?**
**A:** Regular foods typically begin Week 8 post-surgery. Diet progresses: Week 1 (clear liquids), Weeks 2-3 (full liquids), Weeks 4-6 (pureed/soft foods), Week 8+ (regular foods). Always follow your surgeon's specific timeline, which may vary slightly.
