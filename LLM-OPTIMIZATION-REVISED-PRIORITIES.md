## üéØ Current Priorities (Based on Your Feedback)

### Priority 1: HowTo Schema Markup ‚úÖ APPROVED
**Status:** Pending  
**Why:** Helps LLMs understand step-by-step processes  
**Where to add:**
- Recovery guides (week-by-week recovery blog posts)
- Pre-op diet guides
- Stage 1-4 recipe posts
- Any "how to" content

**Example pages:**
- `/blog/gastric-sleeve-recovery-week-by-week.astro`
- `/blog/pre-op-diet-gastric-sleeve.astro`
- `/blog/stage-1-clear-liquid-recipes.astro`
- `/blog/stage-2-full-liquid-recipes.astro`
- `/blog/stage-3-pureed-food-recipes.astro`
- `/blog/stage-4-soft-food-recipes.astro`

**Implementation:** Add structured `HowTo` schema with steps to each guide

---

### Priority 2: Quick Answers on Remaining Pages
**Status:** In Progress  
**Already done:** 3 procedure pages (gastric-sleeve, gastric-bypass, gastric-sleeve-sydney)  
**Still need:** 15 more procedure pages + top 20 location pages

**Why:** LLMs love direct, scannable answers  
**What:** Add QuickAnswer component to remaining pages with:
- Direct cost answer
- Key eligibility criteria
- Expected weight loss
- Recovery timeline

---

### Priority 3: Content Freshness on All Pages
**Status:** In Progress  
**What:** Add ContentFreshness badge to all remaining pages  
**Why:** Signals to LLMs that information is current and trustworthy

---

### Priority 4: Expand FAQs on Individual Pages
**Status:** Pending  
**Current:** Most pages have 10 FAQs  
**Goal:** Expand to 20-30 FAQs per page  
**Why:** More questions = more chances for LLM citation  
**Note:** Keep UX in mind - use collapsible accordion format

---

## ‚ùå Cancelled Items (Based on Your Feedback)

### 1. Ultimate Guide Pages (8,000+ words) - CANCELLED
**Reason:** Current long blog posts have poor UX/readability  
**Next steps:** Fix UX on existing long posts first before creating more

### 2. Interactive Procedure Matcher Quiz - CANCELLED
**Reason:** User preference

### 3. Recovery Timeline Calculator - CANCELLED
**Reason:** User hesitant

### 4. "Top Surgeons" List Pages - CANCELLED
**Reason:** AHPRA compliance - can't use "top" or "best" rankings  
**Alternative:** Could create "Find Surgeons in [City]" pages without rankings, but may not be necessary

- Add table of contents to long posts
- Better typography and spacing
- More visual breaks (images, callouts, infographics)

### Alternative to "Top Surgeons":
- Could create "Experienced Bariatric Surgeons in Sydney" (no ranking)
- Focus on qualifications, procedures offered, locations

### LLM Optimization Beyond Content:
- Site speed (already good)
- Mobile experience (already good)
- Schema markup (ongoing)
- Regular content updates (set up schedule)
