oka# Simple AI Email System PRD
## Form-Based Segmentation for BariatricSurgeryHub

**Document Version:** 1.0 - Simplified
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Implementation Time:** 1-2 weeks (vs 12 weeks for full system)
**Complexity:** LOW - Perfect for getting started

---

## üéØ The Simple Version

### Core Concept
**Different lead forms = Different interests = Different email sequences**

Instead of tracking 20+ data points, we simply segment based on **which form the person filled out**. This tells us their primary interest and we nurture them accordingly.

### Why This Works
- ‚úÖ **Simple to implement** - No complex behavioral tracking
- ‚úÖ **High relevance** - Form choice reveals intent
- ‚úÖ **Easy to maintain** - One sequence per form
- ‚úÖ **Quick wins** - Launch in days, not months
- ‚úÖ **Scalable** - Add more forms/sequences as you grow

---

    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      subscribers: [{

        first_name: firstName,
        tags: ['calculator_user'],
        custom_fields: {

## ‚ùì FAQ

### "Do I need coding skills?"
**No.** Use Drip's visual workflow builder + AI-generated emails. Option to code custom integrations if you want, but not required.

### "What if I don't have these exact forms?"
**Adapt the concept.** Use whatever lead magnets you have:
- Blog post downloads
- Webinar registrations
- Quiz completions
- Page visits (via tracking pixels)

### "How long until I see results?"
**Week 1:** System running
**Week 2-4:** First conversions
**Month 2:** Optimized based on data
**Month 3:** Consistent revenue stream

### "Can I start with just one form?"
**Yes!** Start with your highest-traffic form:
- Likely Cost Calculator or Contact Form
- Build one perfect sequence
- Prove ROI
- Add more forms/sequences

### "What if someone fills out multiple forms?"
**They get multiple sequences.** That's okay! More touchpoints = higher conversion. Or set rules in Drip:
- If already in sequence A, don't start sequence B
- Or pause sequence A when B starts

### "How do I know which emails to send when?"
**Test and learn:**
- Start with the cadence suggested above
- Monitor open rates (if dropping, too frequent)
- Monitor unsubscribes (red flag if >0.5%)
- Adjust timing based on YOUR data
