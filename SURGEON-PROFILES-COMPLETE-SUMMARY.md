## üîç **WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED (AND WHY)**

### ‚ùå **Professional Memberships**
- **Why:** Not available on surgeon websites or Google Maps
- **Solution:** Can be added manually for top surgeons if you provide the data

### ‚ùå **Operating Hours**
- **Why:** Not reliably available on most surgeon websites
- **Solution:** Google Maps has this data, but would need additional API access

### ‚ùå **Pricing Information**
- **Why:** Most surgeons don't publicly list prices
- **Solution:** Bio mentions "contact for pricing" as standard practice

### ‚úÖ **What We DID Include Instead:**
- Real Google Maps ratings & reviews
- Estimated years of experience
- Estimated number of procedures performed
- Direct links to Google Maps (where users can see hours)
- Direct links to websites (where users can inquire about pricing)

### 2. **Additional Photo Collection**
For the 31 surgeons without photos (37%):

### 3. **Real Google Reviews**
To display actual review text (not just ratings):
- Sign up for Google Maps API
