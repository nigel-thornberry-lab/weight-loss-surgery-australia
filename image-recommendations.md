# Weight Loss Surgery Australia - Image Recommendations

## Analysis Summary
After crawling the website, I identified that the site is currently very text-heavy and sterile, lacking visual elements that would build trust and improve user engagement. The site needs strategic image placement to:

1. **Build Trust** - Show real people, medical professionals, and authentic environments
2. **Reduce Anxiety** - Use calming, supportive imagery for a sensitive medical topic
3. **Improve Conversion** - Add visual proof and credibility to key decision points
4. **Enhance UX** - Break up text-heavy sections with relevant visuals

## 1. Homepage Hero Section
**Page:** https://weight-loss-surgery-australia-7uslm8v19.vercel.app  
**Location:** Above the fold hero section  
**Current Issue:** Text-only hero with no visual elements to build trust

### Image Prompt:
```
A warm, supportive scene of a diverse group of 3-4 Australian adults (ages 30-50, mixed genders) in casual, comfortable clothing, standing together in a modern Australian medical center or clinic waiting room. They should look confident, hopeful, and supportive of each other. The setting should be clean, modern, and professional but not sterile. Soft, natural lighting. The people should appear to be in different stages of their weight loss journey - some at the beginning, others further along. Include subtle Australian elements like native plants or architecture. The mood should be encouraging and non-judgmental, conveying hope and support.
```

### Reasoning:
- **Trust Building:** Real people in a medical setting builds credibility
- **Relatability:** Diverse group shows the service is for everyone
- **Emotional Connection:** Supportive, hopeful mood reduces anxiety about surgery
- **Australian Context:** Local setting builds trust for Australian patients

## 2. Gastric Sleeve Procedure Page Hero
**Page:** https://weight-loss-surgery-australia-7uslm8v19.vercel.app/procedures/gastric-sleeve

**Current Issue:** Text-heavy introduction without visual context

### Image Prompt:
```
A professional medical illustration or diagram showing a cross-section of a human torso with the stomach highlighted, showing the gastric sleeve procedure. The image should be clean, medical-grade, and educational but not intimidating. Include before/after stomach size comparison. The illustration should be in soft blues and whites, professional medical style, with clear labels. Include a small inset showing a happy, healthy person (30-40 years old) in casual Australian setting, looking confident and healthy.
```

### Reasoning:
- **Educational Value:** Helps patients understand the procedure
