Patients searching for bariatric surgeons in [City] will see 
verified profiles for these surgeons, but not yours.

Otherwise, no worries - best of luck with your practice.

Best regards,

## OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE

### Objection 1: "I don't need more patients"
**Response:** 
"This isn't about volume - it's about quality. Verified profiles attract patients who've done their research and are serious about surgery. Plus, it's about professional reputation and competitive positioning. Your colleagues are being verified - you should be too."

### Objection 2: "I already have a website"
**Response:**
"Absolutely, and your website is important. This is complementary - it's an additional channel where patients search. Think of it like having both a practice website AND a Google Business Profile. Plus, the badge links back to your website, improving your SEO."

### Objection 3: "What's the catch?"
**Response:**
"No catch. We're building the most comprehensive bariatric surgery resource in Australia. We make money from advertising and partnerships, not from surgeons. Your verified profile makes our directory more valuable. Win-win."

### Objection 4: "I don't have time for this"
**Response:**
"That's exactly why we built it this way. You invest 20 minutes once. We handle everything else - writing, updates, maintenance, compliance. Set it and forget it."

### Objection 5: "How do I know this is legitimate?"
**Response:**
"Great question. We're AHPRA-compliant (here's our compliance documentation), we use transparent verification methodology, and we're already working with [X] surgeons including Dr. [Name] at [Hospital]. Happy to provide references."

### Objection 6: "I'm concerned about AHPRA compliance"
**Response:**
"We've done the legal work. Our profiles display only factual information - credentials, experience, affiliations. No testimonials, no 'best' claims, no promotional content. Just verification. In fact, this helps you by providing accurate information that you control."

### Objection 7: "What if I want to be removed later?"
**Response:**
"No problem. No contracts, no commitments. Just email us and we'll remove your profile within 24 hours. You're in complete control."

### Objection 8: "Why are you doing this for free?"
**Response:**
"We're building long-term value. A comprehensive, trusted directory benefits everyone - patients get better information, surgeons get qualified inquiries, and we build a sustainable business through advertising and partnerships. We're playing the long game."
