## üéØ Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Phase 2A: High-Traffic Location Pages** (Est. 2-3 hours)

These pages target your Reddit keywords ("weight loss surgery Sydney", "gastric sleeve Melbourne", etc.)

#### **Priority 1: Main Location Pages**
Add RegistryStats + ClinicalGuidelines components to:
- [ ] `/procedures/gastric-sleeve-sydney.astro` (HIGHEST - matches keyword "weight loss surgery Sydney")
- [ ] `/procedures/gastric-sleeve-melbourne.astro` (HIGH - matches keyword)
- [ ] `/procedures/gastric-bypass-sydney.astro`
- [ ] `/procedures/gastric-bypass-melbourne.astro`

**Implementation:**
```astro
// Add to imports
import RegistryStats from '../../components/RegistryStats.astro';
import ClinicalGuidelines from '../../components/ClinicalGuidelines.astro';
import AuthorityCitations from '../../components/AuthorityCitations.astro';

// Add before closing sections (before surgeon CTA)
<section class="py-12 bg-gray-50">
  <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 text-center">Evidence-Based Information</h2>
    <RegistryStats />
    <ClinicalGuidelines />
    <AuthorityCitations />
  </div>
</section>
```

**SEO Impact:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Targets main Reddit keywords + location-based search intent)

### **Phase 2B: Other Comparison Pages** (Est. 1-2 hours)

Add OutcomeComparison + AuthorityCitations to:
- [ ] `/compare/gastric-bypass-vs-mini-bypass.astro`
- [ ] `/compare/surgery-vs-medication.astro`

**For Bypass vs Mini Bypass:**
```astro
<OutcomeComparison
  procedure1="Gastric Bypass (Roux-en-Y)"
  procedure2="Mini Gastric Bypass"
  weightLoss1="70-80%"
  weightLoss2="65-75%"
  diabetesRemission1="80-90%"
  diabetesRemission2="70-85%"
  complicationRate1="2-3%"
  complicationRate2="1.5-2.5%"
/>
```

**For Surgery vs Medication:**
Create a modified version showing 5-year outcomes and cost comparisons.

**SEO Impact:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Targets decision-stage keywords like "gastric bypass or sleeve")

---

### **Phase 2C: Cost Pages** (Est. 1 hour)

These already have some data but could be enhanced:
- [ ] `/costs/gastric-bypass-cost-australia.astro`
- [ ] `/costs/gastric-sleeve-cost-australia.astro`

**Add:** Small registry stats callout box (similar to what we added to the blog post)

### **Phase 2D: FAQ Page** (Est. 30 mins)

- [ ] `/faq.astro`

**Add:**
- Small authority note at the top referencing ANZBSR and ANZMOSS

<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 mb-8">
  <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 rounded">
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
      <strong>Medically Informed Answers:</strong> All information based on Australian & New Zealand
      Bariatric Surgery Registry (ANZBSR) data, Medicare Benefits Schedule guidelines, and ANZMOSS
      clinical standards.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**SEO Impact:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Supports overall site authority)

### **Phase 2E: Remaining Location Pages** (Est. 2-3 hours)

Lower priority but good for comprehensive coverage:
- [ ] All other `/procedures/*-sydney.astro` pages

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Don't Overdo It:** Not every page needs all three components. Use judgment based on page type and user intent.

2. **Test Mobile:** All components are responsive, but always check on mobile after adding.

3. **Monitor Load Time:** Components are lightweight, but keep an eye on page speed scores.

4. **A/B Test Placement:** Try components in different positions to see what users engage with most.

5. **Update Regularly:** Fresh data = fresh content signal to Google. Set calendar reminders for ANZBSR report releases.
