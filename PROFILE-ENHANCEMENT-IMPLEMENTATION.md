- Google Places API: $100/year
- Development time (templates): 8 hours √ó $80/hr = $640
- **Total**: ~$1,240

**Return** (Conservative):
- 3 Featured listings @ $499/mo = $1,497/mo
- 4 Enhanced listings @ $199/mo = $796/mo
- **Total MRR**: $2,293/mo

**ROI**: $1,240 investment ‚Üí $2,293/mo = Break even in 2 weeks

## ‚úÖ Next Steps - Choose Path:

### Option A: Full Automation (Recommended Long-term)
1. Get Google Places API key
2. Build automated scraping
3. Roll out to all 88 surgeons
4. Monthly auto-updates
