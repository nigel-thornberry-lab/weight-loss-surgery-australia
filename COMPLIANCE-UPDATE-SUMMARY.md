## ⚠️ Important: What You Cannot Do

### ❌ Do Not Display Individual Reviews
Even if:
- They're from Google (third-party)
- You add disclaimers
- They're "verified"
- They seem non-clinical

**If your website promotes health services AND you display the review → BREACH**

### ❌ Do Not Use Fake/Sample Reviews
- Even as placeholders
- Even if marked as "sample"
- This is misleading advertising under Australian Consumer Law

### ❌ Do Not Selectively Edit Reviews
- Removing negative parts
- Cherry-picking only positive reviews
- Editing to change meaning

## 📝 Files You Can Safely Keep

These files remain in your codebase but **reviews are not displayed**:

1. **`src/data/cached-reviews.json`**
   - Contains full review content
   - Used only for generating Google Maps links
   - Can be used for internal analytics
   - NOT displayed on website

2. **`src/data/slug-to-placeid.json`**
   - Maps surgeon slugs to Google Place IDs
   - Used to generate correct Google Maps links
   - Essential for "Read Reviews" button

3. **Review Collection Scripts**
   - `api/google-reviews.js`
   - `scripts/fetch-reviews.cjs` (if exists)
   - Can continue to collect data
   - Just don't display individual reviews
