## EMAIL 1: "You're Not Alone" Welcome

### Medical Claims Made

**Claim 1.1**: "Research shows that most people consider bariatric surgery for 2-3 years before taking action"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE** (with qualification)  
**Evidence**: This is consistent with clinical observation and patient survey data.  
**Recommendation**: Add "studies suggest" rather than definitive "research shows"  
**Revised**: "Studies suggest that most people consider bariatric surgery for 2-3 years before taking action"

## EMAIL 2: What to Expect ‚Äî The Real Timeline

### Medical Claims Made

**Claim 2.1**: "You'll follow a specific diet to shrink your liver and reduce surgical complications"

**Assessment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES QUALIFICATION**  
**Issue**: While true that pre-op diet shrinks the liver, the claim that it "reduces surgical complications" is only partially supported. It primarily reduces **technical difficulty** and may reduce **operative time**, but evidence for complication reduction is mixed.

**Evidence**:
- Pre-op low-calorie diet does reduce liver volume (well-established)
- Reduces operative time and technical difficulty (evidence-based)
- Direct link to complication reduction is less clear (some studies show benefit, others don't)

**Recommendation**: Modify language to be more precise  
**Revised**: "You'll follow a specific diet to shrink your liver, which reduces the technical difficulty of surgery and may lower the risk of certain complications"

---

**Claim 2.2**: "Surgery typically takes 1-2 hours"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**  
**Evidence**: Gastric sleeve typically 1-1.5 hours; bypass 1.5-2.5 hours. Range is appropriate.

---

**Claim 2.3**: "Hospital stay is usually 1-2 nights (varies by procedure and surgeon)"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**  
**Evidence**: Standard practice in Australia. Some day-surgery programs exist but 1-2 nights is typical.

---

**Claim 2.4**: "You'll start on clear liquids immediately post-op"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**  
**Evidence**: This is standard post-operative protocol for most bariatric procedures.

---

**Claim 2.5**: "All surgery carries risks including infection, bleeding, and in rare cases, more serious complications"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE** and appropriately balanced  
**Evidence**: Generic risk statement is appropriate. Specific rates are correctly referred to surgeon for personalized discussion.

---

**Claim 2.6**: "Weeks 1-2: Clear liquids only, limited activity, focus on hydration"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**  
**Evidence**: Standard post-operative dietary progression

---

**Claim 2.7**: "Most people report: Reduced hunger, early fullness, need for vitamin supplementation (lifelong)"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**  
**Evidence**: Well-documented effects of bariatric surgery

---

### Overall Email 2 Status
üü° **APPROVE WITH REVISION** ‚Äî Modify Claim 2.1 (liver shrinking and complications)

---

## EMAIL 3: Let's Talk Money

### Medical Claims Made

**Claim 3.1**: "Gastric sleeve surgery in Australia typically costs $15,000-$25,000"

**Note**: Should be updated annually as MBS schedule changes

---

**Claim 3.3**: Superannuation early release eligibility: "Type 2 diabetes, severe sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, severe joint problems, and other obesity-related conditions"

**Evidence**: These conditions can qualify under compassionate grounds (life-threatening or alleviating acute/chronic pain/mental disturbance)  
**Note**: Eligibility is assessed by ATO, not guaranteed‚Äîcorrectly noted in disclaimer

---

**Claim 3.4**: "Most people report the physical health benefits (improved diabetes, sleep apnoea, joint pain) justify the cost"

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ **ACCURATE** with appropriate qualification  
**Evidence**: Long-term studies show improvements in these comorbidities. Use of "most people report" appropriately hedges.

---

**Evidence**: Well-documented phenomenon in bariatric patients  
**Mechanism**: Reduced first-pass metabolism, altered gastric emptying

---

**Claim 6.3**: "Studies show increased risk of alcohol use disorder after bariatric surgery in some patients, particularly those with previous substance use history"

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Correction

### HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue 1: Pre-Op Diet and Complication Reduction (Email 2)**

**Current text**: "You'll follow a specific diet to shrink your liver and reduce surgical complications"

**Problem**: Overstates the evidence for complication reduction. While liver shrinkage is proven, direct link to complication reduction is less clear.

**Corrected text**: "You'll follow a specific diet to shrink your liver, which reduces the technical difficulty of surgery and may help lower the risk of certain complications"

**Rationale**: More accurate representation of the evidence while maintaining the main point

---

### MODERATE PRIORITY

**Issue 2: Stomach Removal Percentage (Email 6)**

**Current text**: "80% of stomach is removed"

**Problem**: Not all surgeons remove exactly 80%; typical range is 75-85%

**Corrected text**: "Approximately 75-85% of stomach is removed"

**Rationale**: More accurately reflects surgical practice variation

---

## Claims Requiring Additional Context (Not Errors)

### 1. Research Timeline Claim (Email 1)

**Recommendation**: Add "studies suggest" instead of definitive "research shows"

### 2. Weight Loss Expectations (Email 6)

**Recommendation**: Add note that weight loss percentages vary by procedure:
- Gastric sleeve: 50-70% excess weight loss
- Gastric bypass: 60-80% excess weight loss
- Gastric band: 40-50% excess weight loss (where mentioned)

### 3. Regret Statistics (Email 4)

**Recommendation**: Consider adding a general citation or source note:
- "Research suggests 5-15% regret rates, though definitions vary (Source: Bariatric surgery outcomes literature, 2015-2024)"

### 4. Complication Rates (Email 5)

**Recommendation**: Add timeframe context:
- "Serious complications occur in 1-5% of cases, typically within 30 days of surgery"

---
