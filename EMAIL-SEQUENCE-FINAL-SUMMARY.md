3. **Domain Authority**: Google rewards quality backlinks
4. **Zero Effort**: Simple HTML snippet, 5-minute install

### **How It's Presented:**

**Email 1:**
> "About that badge: It's not just a trust signal for patients. It's a quality backlink from our directory to your practice website. Your web developer adds one snippet of code, and you get an SEO boost. Simple."

**Email 2:**
> "We get:
> ‚Ä¢ A more comprehensive directory
> ‚Ä¢ Increased credibility with patients
> ‚Ä¢ Advertising revenue (not from you)
> ‚Ä¢ Backlink via the 'verified' badge on your site"

**Email 4:**
> "The badge isn't just for show. It's a quality backlink from our directory back to your practice website.
>
