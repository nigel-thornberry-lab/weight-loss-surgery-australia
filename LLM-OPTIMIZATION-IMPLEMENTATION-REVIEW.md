## 📝 Notes

2. **Styling:** Pages use Tailwind CSS classes consistent with existing site design.

3. **Links:** Some internal links (like `/compare`, `/am-i-ready`) may need index pages created or URL adjustments.

4. **Content Accuracy:** All statistics and claims should be verified against:
   - OSSANZ published guidelines
   - Current Medicare Benefits Schedule
   - Recent market pricing data
   - Published clinical research

5. **Future Medical Review:** Consider partnering with a real FRACS-certified surgeon to review content and add legitimate credentials.
