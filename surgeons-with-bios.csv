The practice offers **Gastric Sleeve Surgery** (Sleeve Gastrectomy), a highly effective procedure that reduces stomach size by approximately 80%, helping patients achieve significant weight loss through portion control and hormonal changes that reduce appetite. **Gastric Bypass Surgery** (Roux-en-Y) is also available, combining stomach size reduction with intestinal rerouting to maximize weight loss results and improve metabolic health conditions. For patients seeking an adjustable, reversible option, **Gastric Band Surgery** (Lap-Band) provides a minimally invasive approach to weight management.
