**Goal:** Make the backlink offer SO valuable that 90%+ surgeons install the badge

## THE POST-APPROVAL INTERVIEW SEQUENCE

### **Email 5: Badge Delivery (Day 0 - Immediately After Approval)**
*Already covered in previous document*

### **Email 6: Interview Invitation (Day 3 - After Badge Email)**

**Subject:** Quick interview for your profile? (10 questions, huge SEO boost)

```
Dr. [Name],

Your verified profile is getting views. Nice.

But I want to make it even better.

Here's what I'm offering to verified surgeons:

A featured Q&A interview on your profile.

10 questions about your approach, philosophy, and experience.

Why bother?

1. **Differentiation**: Patients compare surgeons. This makes you 
   stand out. They see your personality, not just credentials.

2. **SEO Boost**: 800+ words of unique content on your profile. 
   Google loves this. You'll rank higher.

3. **Blog Feature**: I'll turn your interview into a blog post:
   "Meet Dr. [Name]: [City]'s Expert in [Specialty]"
   
   That's a SECOND backlink to your practice website.

4. **Evergreen Content**: Your interview becomes permanent 
   content that ranks in Google for years. Patients searching 
   for "[your name] approach" or "[your name] philosophy" will 
   find it.

5. **Competitive Advantage**: Most surgeons just list 
   credentials. You'll have a full interview showing your 
   personality and approach. That's differentiation.

Total additional value: $8,000+

Your time investment: 15 minutes

Here's how it works:

1. I send you 10 questions (see below)
2. You reply with your answers (voice memo, typed, or phone call)
3. I write it up professionally
4. You approve the final version
5. I publish it on your profile + blog

Done.

Want to see an example?

Check out Dr. [Early Adopter]'s interview: [EXAMPLE URL]

His profile now ranks for "[his name] bariatric surgeon philosophy" 
and similar long-tail keywords. That's organic traffic he wasn't 
getting before.

Interested? Just reply "YES" and tell me which option you prefer.

Cameron

P.S. This is only available to verified surgeons. It's part of 
our commitment to showcasing the best practitioners in Australia.

P.P.S. If you're too busy right now, reply "LATER" and I'll 
follow up in 3 months. But the sooner we do this, the sooner 
you get the SEO boost.
```

---

### **Email 7: Interview Follow-Up (Day 7 - If No Response)**

**Subject:** Still interested in the interview?

```
Dr. [Name],

I sent you the interview invitation last week.

Haven't heard back yet.

I'm guessing one of three things:

1. You're interested but swamped (I get it)
2. You're not sure it's worth your time
3. These emails are going to spam (oops)

Let me address #2:

**Is it worth 15 minutes?**

Here's what Dr. [Early Adopter] said after we published his:

"I was skeptical about spending time on this, but the results 
were immediate. My profile views doubled, and I've received 
several patient inquiries mentioning they read my interview. 
It helped them feel like they knew me before even calling."

His profile now ranks #1 for "[city] bariatric surgeon interview."

That's organic traffic he wasn't getting before.

Plus, he got a second backlink from the blog post.

**Total time invested:** 15 minutes on a phone call with me.

**Return:** Ongoing SEO value + patient trust + differentiation.

Worth it?

If yes, reply "YES" and I'll send you the questions.

If no, reply "NO" and I'll stop asking.

If later, reply "3 MONTHS" and I'll follow up then.

Cameron

P.S. The offer expires in 30 days. After that, I'm only doing 
interviews with new verified surgeons. First-come, first-served.
```

---

### **Email 8: Interview Final Offer (Day 14 - If Still No Response)**

**Subject:** Last chance for featured interview

```
Dr. [Name],

This is my last email about the interview.

I'm closing the offer in 7 days.

After that, interviews are only available to new verified 
surgeons or as a paid upgrade ($500).

Why am I limiting it?

Because I can only do 5 interviews per month. Quality takes time.

Right now, I have 2 spots left this month.

If you want one, reply "YES" by [DATE].

If not, no worries. Your verified profile is still live and 
working great.

But you'll miss out on:
→ 800+ words of unique content on your profile
→ Second backlink from blog feature
→ Social media amplification
→ Newsletter feature (5,000+ subscribers)
→ 40%+ increase in profile views (based on early data)

Your call.

Cameron

P.S. If you're genuinely too busy, I understand. But 15 minutes 
now = ongoing SEO value for years. Worth considering.
```

---

## THE BLOG FEATURE STRATEGY

### **After Interview is Complete:**

**Email 9: Blog Feature Notification**

**Subject:** Your interview is live + blog feature published

```
Dr. [Name],

Your interview is now live on your profile: [PROFILE URL]

And I've published a blog feature article:

"Meet Dr. [Name]: [City]'s Expert in [Specialty Approach]"

Blog URL: [BLOG URL]

This article includes:
→ Your interview highlights
→ Your credentials and experience
→ Link to your practice website (backlink #2)
→ Link to your verified profile
→ Patient testimonials (if available)
→ Call-to-action to book consultation

This article is now:
→ Indexed by Google (searchable immediately)
→ Linked from your verified profile
→ Optimized for "[your name] bariatric surgeon" keywords
→ Permanent content that ranks for years

Your profile views should increase significantly over the 
next 2-4 weeks as Google indexes the new content.

Now, about that badge...

Have you added it to your website yet?

If not, here's why you should:

With the interview + blog feature, you now have TWO backlinks 
from our directory. But we also want to link BACK to you.

The badge creates that reciprocal link.

It tells Google: "This surgeon is verified, featured, and 
trusted by our directory."

That's powerful SEO juice.

If you haven't installed it yet, reply "INSTALL" and I'll 
do it for you. Takes me 10 minutes.

Or if you already did, reply "DONE" and send me your website 
URL so I can verify it's working correctly.

Thanks for being part of our verified surgeon network.

Cameron

P.S. If you're happy with the interview and blog feature, 
feel free to share it on your own social media or website. 
It's great content that shows your expertise and approach.
