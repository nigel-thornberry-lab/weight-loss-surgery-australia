# REALISTIC Backlink Options - What Surgeons Will ACTUALLY Do

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Reality Check:** Stop being delusional about email signatures

---

## WHAT SURGEONS WON'T DO

❌ **Email Signature** - Too unprofessional, won't happen
❌ **LinkedIn Bio** - Same reason, professional image matters
❌ **Social Media Links** - Not their style
❌ **Anything that makes them look promotional**

**Face it:** Surgeons are conservative professionals. They won't add directory links to personal branding.

---

## WHAT SURGEONS MIGHT ACTUALLY DO

### **Option 1: Small Footer Badge (The Original Plan)**

**Reality:** This is still the best option.

**Why they'll do it:**
- Goes in website footer (not prominent)
- Looks professional (trust badge)
- Shows credibility
- Hidden enough to not feel promotional

**Friction:**
- Requires web developer
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Need website access

**Realistic Conversion: 70-80%**

**This is probably the best we can do.**

---

### **Option 2: "As Featured On" Section**

**What it is:**
Many surgeon websites have an "As Featured On" or "Memberships" section listing:
- FRACS
- ANZMOSS
- Hospital affiliations
- Media appearances

**The ask:**
"Add 'Verified Surgeon - Weight Loss Surgery Australia' to this list"

**Why they'll do it:**
- Natural fit with other credentials
- Makes them look more credible
- Not promotional, just factual
- Small text link, not prominent

**Friction:**
- Still requires web developer
- Takes 2-5 minutes
- Less visual than badge

**Realistic Conversion: 60-70%**

---

### **Option 3: Link from Existing "Reviews" Disclaimer**

**What it is:**
Many surgeon websites have AHPRA-compliant review disclaimers like:

"Patient reviews are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute medical advice."

**The ask:**
Add one sentence:
"For verified credentials, see our profile on Weight Loss Surgery Australia."

**Why they'll do it:**
- Fits naturally with compliance language
- Adds value (directs to verified info)
- AHPRA compliant
- Small, non-promotional

**Friction:**
- Requires web developer
- Takes 2 minutes
- Only works if they have reviews section

**Realistic Conversion: 50-60%**

---

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

### **There is NO zero-friction backlink option.**

**Why:**
1. Surgeons don't control their websites (web developers do)
2. Surgeons are conservative (won't add promotional links)
3. Any backlink requires website access
4. Any backlink requires someone's time

**The badge is still the best option because:**
- It's a professional trust signal
- It's what other directories do (HealthShare, RateMDs)
- It's expected in this context
- 70-80% will do it (which is actually good)

---

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: MAKE IT EVEN EASIER

### **What if WE do ALL the work?**

**The Offer:**

"After you approve your profile, I'll install the verified badge
on your website for you.

All I need:
1. Your website platform (WordPress, Squarespace, etc.)
2. Temporary admin access (I'll remove myself after)

I'll:
- Install the badge in your footer
- Make sure it looks good
- Test it on mobile
- Send you a screenshot
- Remove my access immediately

Takes me 10 minutes. Takes you 0 minutes.

Just reply 'YES' and I'll send you instructions for creating
a temporary admin account."

**Why this might work better:**
- Zero effort for them
- Zero technical knowledge needed
- Zero time investment
- We control quality/placement

**Realistic Conversion: 85-90%**

**The catch:**
- Requires trust (giving us website access)
- Requires us to do the work (time investment)
- Requires us to know multiple platforms

---

## THE REAL QUESTION

### **Do we even NEED their permission?**

**Controversial idea:**

What if we just:
1. Create their profile (we're doing this anyway)
2. Send them the notification
3. DON'T ask for badge installation
4. Build directory authority through other means

**Other backlink strategies:**
- Guest posts on medical blogs
- Press releases (journalists link to us)
- Resource pages (hospitals, patient advocacy groups)
- Medical directories (link exchanges)
- Content partnerships (co-create with surgeons)

**Reality:**
- 100 surgeon badges = 70-80 backlinks
- 10 high-quality guest posts = 10 backlinks (but higher DA)
- 5 press mentions = 5 backlinks (but VERY high DA)

**Maybe the badge isn't the main backlink strategy?**

## REVISED STRATEGY

### **Make the Badge Optional, Not Required**

**The Pitch:**

"Your verified profile is now live: [URL]

If you'd like to add a 'Verified Surgeon' badge to your website,
I've made it easy:

OPTION 1: Copy-Paste Code (5 minutes)
[HTML code]
Send this to your web developer.

OPTION 2: I'll Do It For You (0 minutes)
Reply 'INSTALL IT' with your website platform and temporary
admin access. I'll handle everything.

OPTION 3: Skip It
Your profile is live and working. The badge is optional.

The badge helps both of us (trust signal for you, backlink for us),
but it's not required. Your choice.

Cameron"

**Why this works:**
- No pressure
- Optional (reduces resistance)
- Easy options provided
- Honest about mutual benefit

**Realistic Conversion: 60-70%**

**But:**
- Less guilt/reciprocity
- They might just skip it
- We get fewer backlinks

## THE BEST REALISTIC APPROACH

### **Combination Strategy:**

**1. Lead with "I'll Do It For You"**

Make this the PRIMARY option, not tertiary:

"One small thing I'll ask after you approve:

I'll add a 'Verified Surgeon' badge to your website footer.

It's a trust signal for patients and helps our directory build authority.

All I need is temporary admin access to your website. I'll:
- Install the badge (takes me 10 minutes)
- Make sure it looks professional
- Test it on mobile
- Remove my access immediately

Reply 'YES' and I'll send you instructions for creating a
temporary admin account.

Or if you prefer to do it yourself, I can send you the code.

Your choice."

**Why this works:**
- Zero effort for them (highest conversion)
- We control quality
- Faster implementation
- Shows we're serious about making it easy

**Realistic Conversion: 85-90%**

---

**2. If They Say "I'll Do It Myself"**

Send them:
- HTML code
- WordPress instructions
- Squarespace instructions
- "Or reply 'CHANGED MY MIND' and I'll do it for you"

**Conversion of self-installers: 50-60%**

---

**3. If They Don't Respond**

Follow up after 3 days:
"Did you get a chance to create that temporary admin account?

I'm ready to install your verified badge whenever you are.

Takes me 10 minutes. Takes you 2 minutes to create the account.

Reply 'YES' and I'll send instructions."

**Conversion after follow-up: +10-15%**

---

## FINAL REALISTIC NUMBERS

### **Expected Backlink Acquisition per 100 Surgeons:**

**Scenario 1: Badge Optional (Low Pressure)**
- 60-70 badges installed
- Lower guilt/reciprocity

**Scenario 2: We Do It For Them (Primary Option)**
- 85-90 badges installed
- Higher conversion due to zero effort

**Scenario 3: Badge Required (High Pressure)**
- 70-80 badges installed
- Some resistance/pushback

**Recommendation: Scenario 2 (We Do It For Them)**

---

## THE HONEST ANSWER

### **There is no "easier" backlink option than a badge.**

**Why:**
1. Any backlink requires website access
2. Surgeons don't control their websites
3. Professional image matters (no email signatures)
4. Conservative industry (no social media links)

**The badge is the standard because:**
- It's what all directories do
- It's expected in this context
- It's professional looking
- It provides mutual value

**The only way to increase conversion:**
- Make it even easier (we do it for them)
- Reduce friction (temporary admin access)
- Follow up persistently (3 touchpoints)

**Expected result: 85-90% badge installation**

**That's actually really good.**

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**Stop looking for magic solutions.**

The badge is the right approach. Just make it as easy as possible:

1. **Primary offer:** "I'll install it for you" (85-90% conversion)
2. **Secondary offer:** "Here's the code" (50-60% conversion)
3. **Follow-up:** "Still want me to do it?" (+10-15% conversion)

**Total: 85-90% of verified surgeons will have badges**

**That's 85-90 quality backlinks from 100 surgeons.**

**That's excellent.**
