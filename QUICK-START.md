## 📊 Monitor Results

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Script fails with "pattern not found"
**Cause:** Page structure doesn't match expected format

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check which pages failed
python3 apply-enhanced-schema.py 2>&1 | grep "Pattern not found"

# Manually review those pages
```

### Schema validation errors
**Common issues:**
- Missing required field → Add to script
- Invalid URL format → Check canonicalUrl construction
- Undefined value → Add null checks

**Fix:** Update the surgeon page and re-validate

### Build errors after changes
```bash
npm run build
```

If errors occur:
- Check JavaScript syntax in schema definitions
- Look for unclosed brackets/braces
- Verify all template literals use backticks
