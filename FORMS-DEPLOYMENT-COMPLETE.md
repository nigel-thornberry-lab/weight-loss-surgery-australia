## üîß What Was Fixed

### Surgeon Profiles - MAJOR FIX:
**Before:**
- Had `LeadContactForm` component
- **Not connected to anything!**
- Tried to POST to `/api/leads` (doesn't exist)
- **Forms were broken - NO LEADS CAPTURED!**

**After:**
- Replaced with working `ConsultationForm`
- Connected to Google Sheets webhook
- Proper source tracking
- **All 77 surgeon profiles now capture leads!**

This was a critical fix! Surgeon profile pages are HIGH INTENT traffic, and the forms weren't working at all.

## üö® Important Notes

### Form Limitations:
- Using `no-cors` mode for Google Apps Script compatibility
- Can't read response directly (normal behavior)
- Success state shows after submission
- Check Google Sheet to confirm data was received

### If Forms Don't Work:
1. Check `.env` file has correct webhook URL
2. Test webhook directly: `node test-webhook.js` (if you have the file)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Google Apps Script is deployed correctly

### Lead Response Best Practices:
- **Newsletter leads:** Low urgency, add to email list
- **Cost calculator leads:** High urgency for pricing, respond within 24h
- **Consultation leads:** HIGHEST urgency, call within 4-24 hours
- **Surgeon profile leads:** Match with specific surgeon, premium service
