## üöÄ Next Steps - What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Clean Your CSV Data ‚è∞ 15-30 minutes

Create a CSV file named `surgeons-cleaned.csv` with these **REQUIRED** columns:

```csv
business_name,surgeon_name,city,state,google_maps_url,website
"Melbourne Centre Dr. Andrew Huo",Andrew Huo,Richmond,VIC,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...,http://www.melbourneweightloss.com.au/
"Bariatrics Melbourne",Andrew Packiyanathan,Melbourne,VIC,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...,http://bariatricsmelbourne.com.au/
```

**Critical Requirements:**
1. `google_maps_url` - MUST be full Google Maps URL (with place_id or cid)
2. `website` - MUST start with http:// or https://
3. `city` and `state` - For proper page organization

**How to Get Google Maps URLs:**
1. Search surgeon on Google Maps
2. Click on their listing  
3. Copy the URL from browser address bar
4. Should look like: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/...` or `https://maps.google.com/?cid=...`

### Step 2: Install Dependencies ‚è∞ 2-5 minutes

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages for the scraper.

### Step 3: Run The Scraper ‚è∞ 20-60 minutes (depending on surgeon count)

```bash
npm run scrape:surgeons surgeons-cleaned.csv surgeons-enriched-full.csv
```

**What happens:**
- Opens each surgeon's Google Maps page
- Extracts 10 real reviews per surgeon
- Extracts operating hours
- Downloads practice photos
- Visits surgeon website
- Finds procedures offered
- Extracts professional memberships
- Finds pricing (if listed)
- Finds surgeon photo
- Saves everything to `surgeons-enriched-full.csv`

**Expected Time:**
- 2-3 seconds per surgeon
- 100 surgeons = ~5-10 minutes
- 400 surgeons = ~20-40 minutes

### Step 4: Review & Upload Enriched CSV ‚è∞ 10-20 minutes

1. Open `surgeons-enriched-full.csv`
2. Verify data looks good
3. Fix any obvious errors (rare)
4. Replace `surgeons-with-bios.csv` with your enriched file

**OR** upload the cleaned CSV to this chat and I'll run the script for you!

### Step 5: Generate Profile Pages ‚è∞ 5 minutes

I'll create an updated page generation script that uses all the new data fields.

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small
- Test with 10-20 surgeons first
- Verify data quality
- Then run full dataset

### 2. Google Maps URLs
- The more complete the URL, the better
- URLs with `place_id` are best
- URLs with `cid` also work well

### 3. Website URLs
- MUST start with http:// or https://
- Must be actual surgeon website (not Google Maps link)
- Should be clinic/practice homepage

### 4. Data Validation
- Check for missing Google Maps URLs
- Check for invalid website URLs
- Remove duplicates (same place_id)

### 5. Manual Review
- Some data will need manual correction
- Especially pricing (often not listed publicly)
- Professional photos may need manual upload for key surgeons
