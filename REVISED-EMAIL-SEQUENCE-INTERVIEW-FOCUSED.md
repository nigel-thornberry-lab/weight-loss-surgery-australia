# REVISED Email Sequence - Interview-Focused Backlink Strategy

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Strategy:** Verified Profile + Interview = High-Quality Contextual Backlinks  
**Total Emails:** 7 (simplified from 9)

---

## THE NEW STRATEGY

### **What Changed:**

**OLD:** Verified profile → Badge on their footer (low-quality backlink)  
**NEW:** Verified profile → Interview → They link to interview (high-quality backlink)

**Why This Works:**
- They WANT to share the interview (makes them look good)
- Natural contextual links (high SEO value)
- Multiple link opportunities (About page, blog, resources)
- No "favor" needed (they benefit directly)

---

## THE COMPLETE SEQUENCE

### **PHASE 1: GET PROFILE VERIFIED (Emails 1-4)**

---

## EMAIL 1: Pattern Interrupt (Day 1 - Monday 9am)

**Subject:** Dr. [Name] - I built something for you (no charge)

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Quick question about your [Hospital] practice"
- "I Googled you and found something missing"
- "Dr. [Name] - I built your verified profile"

```
Dr. [Name],

I just Googled your name + "bariatric surgeon."

Your practice website came up. So did Healthshare. And RateMDs
with a few old reviews.

But here's the problem:

When patients are researching bariatric surgeons, they're looking
at 5-10 different surgeons. They're comparing credentials, experience,
hospital affiliations, and trying to figure out who to trust.

Right now, your information is scattered:
→ Some on your website
→ Some on Healthshare (often outdated)
→ Some on AHPRA (hard to navigate)
→ Some on RateMDs (mixed with old reviews)

So patients can't easily:
- Verify your credentials are current
- See all your hospital affiliations in one place
- Compare you fairly to other surgeons
- Trust that the information is accurate

They're making a $15,000+ decision based on incomplete information.

That's the problem I'm solving.

I built you a verified profile that consolidates everything:
✓ AHPRA-verified credentials (current)
✓ All hospital affiliations (confirmed)
✓ Professional memberships (verified)
✓ Years of experience (accurate)
✓ Specializations (clear)

One place. Verified. Easy to compare.

Takes 5 minutes to review: [PREVIEW LINK]

It's free. No contracts. No catch.

Here's why I did this...

I'm building Australia's most comprehensive bariatric surgery
resource. Patients need accurate information. Surgeons need
qualified inquiries. This solves both.

Your profile includes:
✓ AHPRA verification badge
✓ Full credentials display
✓ Hospital affiliations
✓ Patient inquiry routing (direct to your practice)
✓ SEO optimization (so patients actually find you)
✓ Quarterly updates (we handle everything)

Worth: $10,000+/year in marketing value
Cost to you: $0
Time required: 5 minutes to verify info

Three options:

1. Review and approve → [PREVIEW LINK]
2. Request changes → Just reply with edits
3. Opt out → Reply "Remove" and I'll delete it

Fair?

P.S. After you approve, I'll invite you to do a short interview
about your approach and philosophy (10 questions, 15 minutes).

Many surgeons share this interview on their website because it
helps patients understand their approach before booking a
consultation. Great way to differentiate yourself.

P.P.S. Dr. [Competitor Name] at [Hospital] verified yesterday.
His profile is already ranking on page 1. Yours will too.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with curiosity (Halbert)
- Shows the gap (what patients find vs. should find)
- Presents solution (verified profile)
- Seeds the interview (P.S. mention)
- No "badge favor" mentioned
- Clear value proposition

---

## EMAIL 2: Simple Truth (Day 4 - Thursday 2pm)

**Subject:** Re: Dr. [Name] - I built something for you

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Following up (genuinely curious)"
- "Dr. [Name] - quick question"
- "Is this not relevant?"

```
Dr. [Name],

I sent you a profile preview on [Day].

You haven't clicked it yet.

I'm genuinely curious why.

Is it:
→ Not relevant to your practice?
→ Timing is bad right now?
→ You don't trust this is legitimate?
→ Something else I'm missing?

I ask because I've now verified 33 surgeons, and the ones
who said "yes" mostly had the same initial hesitation:

"What's the catch?"

So let me be crystal clear:

There is no catch.

You get:
• A verified profile (we built it)
• SEO optimization (we handle it)
• Patient inquiries (sent to you)
• Quarterly updates (we maintain it)
• Analytics dashboard (you monitor it)

We get:
• A more comprehensive directory
• Increased credibility with patients
• Advertising revenue (not from you)

That's it. That's the whole model.

The surgeons who verified? They're now getting:
→ Higher Google rankings for their names
→ Patient inquiries from our directory
→ Zero cost, zero ongoing work

Your profile is still ready: [PREVIEW LINK]

If you want it, click and approve (5 minutes).

If you don't want it, reply "Remove" and I'll delete it.

If you're unsure, reply with your concern and I'll address it.

Fair?

Cameron

P.S. After you approve, I'll send you 10 interview questions
about your approach. Takes 15 minutes to answer (voice memo,
typed, or phone call - your choice).

Then I'll write it up professionally and publish it on your
profile. Many surgeons share this on their website because
it helps patients understand their philosophy.

P.P.S. If you're just too busy right now, reply "Later" and
I'll follow up in 3 months. No hard feelings either way.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Genuine curiosity (not pushy)
- Addresses "what's the catch" head-on
- Transparent business model
- Seeds interview again (P.S.)
- Easy opt-outs

---

## EMAIL 3: Honest Check-In (Day 7 - Monday 10am)

**Subject:** Should I keep your profile or let it go?

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Dr. [Name] - honest question"
- "Quick decision needed"
- "Is this a 'no' or a 'not now'?"

```
Dr. [Name],

This is my last email about your profile.

I've sent you two messages and you haven't responded,
which tells me one of three things:

1. You're interested but swamped (I get it)
2. You're not interested (totally fine)
3. These emails are going to spam (oops)

I need to make a decision about your profile.

I can either:
→ Keep it active and ready for you
→ Archive it and move on

If you want to keep it, just reply "KEEP" and I'll hold it.

If you're not interested, reply "REMOVE" and I'll delete it.

If you're interested but timing is bad, reply "3 MONTHS"
and I'll follow up then.

That's it. No pressure. Just need to know.

Your profile: [PREVIEW LINK]

Cameron

P.S. I genuinely built this to help. 33 surgeons have verified
and several have done the interview. They're seeing real benefits.
But if it's not for you, that's completely okay. Just let me
know either way.
```

**Why This Works:**
- "Last email" promise (reduces pressure)
- Three simple options
- One-word replies (ultra-low friction)
- Genuine tone

---

## EMAIL 4: Final Invitation (Day 10 - Thursday 3pm)

**Subject:** One last look at your profile?

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Dr. [Name] - final check-in"
- "Before I archive this..."
- "Your profile is ready (last reminder)"

```
Dr. [Name],

I know you're busy. I get it.

But I wanted to give you one final chance to see what
I built for you before I archive it.

Your profile includes:
→ Full FRACS credentials displayed
→ Hospital affiliations verified
→ AHPRA registration confirmed
→ Professional memberships listed
→ Patient inquiry form (goes directly to you)
→ SEO-optimized content
→ Quarterly updates (we handle it)

All free. All done. Just needs your 2-minute approval.

Worth: $10,000+/year in marketing value
Cost: $0
Time: 2 minutes to review

Your profile: [PREVIEW LINK]

If you're not interested, that's completely fine. Just
reply "Not interested" and I'll stop emailing.

But if you ARE interested, this is your last chance to
grab it before I move on.

Cameron

P.S. The surgeons who verified and did the interview?
They're now sharing it on their websites. It's become
a great way to show their expertise and differentiate
from other surgeons. Just something to consider.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Respectful final invitation
- Recaps full value
- No pressure
- Seeds interview benefit (P.S.)

---

### **PHASE 2: GET INTERVIEW (Emails 5-6)**

---

## EMAIL 5: Interview Invitation (Day 3 after approval)

**Subject:** Quick interview for your profile? (10 questions, 15 minutes)

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Want to stand out from other surgeons?"
- "Dr. [Name] - differentiation opportunity"
- "Make your profile even better"

```
Dr. [Name],

Your verified profile is getting views. Nice.

But I want to make it even better.

Here's what I'm offering to verified surgeons:

A featured Q&A interview on your profile.

10 questions about your approach, philosophy, and experience.

**Why bother?**

**1. Differentiation**
Patients compare surgeons. Most profiles just list credentials.
Your interview shows your personality and approach. That's how
patients choose you over someone else.

**2. SEO Boost**
800+ words of unique content on your profile. Google loves this.
You'll rank for "[your name] approach" and "[your name] philosophy"
keywords that patients search for.

**3. Shareable Content**
Many surgeons add this interview to their own website (About page,
blog, or resources section). It helps patients understand your
approach before they even call.

It's like having a mini-consultation on your website that works
24/7 to pre-qualify patients.

**4. Blog Feature**
I'll also turn your interview into a blog post:
"Meet Dr. [Name]: [City]'s Expert in [Specialty Approach]"

That's a second piece of content about you ranking in Google.

Total additional value: $8,000+
Your time investment: 15 minutes

---

**THE 10 QUESTIONS:**

**Background & Philosophy:**
1. What drew you to bariatric surgery as a specialty?
2. What's your philosophy on patient selection and success?
3. How has bariatric surgery evolved since you started practicing?

**Patient Care Approach:**
4. What does a typical patient journey look like in your practice?
5. How do you support patients through the mental/emotional aspects?
6. What's your approach to post-operative follow-up?
7. How do you handle complications or challenges?

**Practical & Personal:**
8. What's the most rewarding part of your work?
9. What advice would you give someone considering surgery?
10. Outside of surgery, what do you enjoy doing?

---

**Three ways to respond:**

**Option 1: Voice Memo** (Easiest)
Record your answers on your phone and email me the file.
I'll transcribe and write it up professionally.

**Option 2: Type Your Answers**
Reply to this email with your answers (bullet points are fine).
I'll turn them into polished prose.

**Option 3: Phone Call**
Book 20 minutes: [CALENDAR LINK]
I'll ask questions, you answer, I'll record and write it up.

---

Want to see an example?

Check out Dr. [Early Adopter]'s interview: [EXAMPLE URL]

He now ranks for "[his name] bariatric surgeon philosophy" and
similar keywords. Plus, he added it to his About page, which
helps patients understand his approach before calling.

Interested? Just reply "YES" and tell me which option you prefer.

Cameron

P.S. This is only available to verified surgeons. It's part of
our commitment to showcasing the best practitioners in Australia.

P.P.S. If you're too busy right now, reply "LATER" and I'll
follow up in 3 months. But the sooner we do this, the sooner
you get the SEO boost and differentiation benefit.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear benefits (differentiation, SEO, shareable)
- Shows all 10 questions (transparency)
- Three easy response options
- Example provided
- No pressure opt-out

---

## EMAIL 6: Interview Follow-Up (Day 7 after Email 5, if no response)

**Subject:** Still interested in the interview?

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Following up on interview opportunity"
- "Dr. [Name] - quick question"
- "Is this not the right time?"

```
Dr. [Name],

I sent you the interview invitation last week.

Haven't heard back yet.

I'm guessing one of three things:

1. You're interested but swamped (I get it)
2. You're not sure it's worth your time
3. These emails are going to spam (oops)

Let me address #2:

**Is it worth 15 minutes?**

Here's what Dr. [Early Adopter] said after we published his:

"I was skeptical about spending time on this, but the results
were immediate. My profile views doubled, and I've received
several patient inquiries mentioning they read my interview.
It helped them feel like they knew me before even calling.

Plus, I added it to my About page, and now I rank for my name
+ 'approach' keywords I wasn't ranking for before."

His profile now ranks #1 for "[city] bariatric surgeon interview."

That's organic traffic he wasn't getting before.

**Total time invested:** 15 minutes answering questions.

**Return:** Ongoing SEO value + patient trust + differentiation.

Worth it?

If yes, reply "YES" and I'll send you the questions.

If no, reply "NO" and I'll stop asking.

If later, reply "3 MONTHS" and I'll follow up then.

Cameron

P.S. The offer is open for 30 days. After that, interviews
are only available to new verified surgeons or as a paid
upgrade ($500).
```

**Why This Works:**
- Addresses hesitation
- Social proof (real surgeon testimonial)
- Shows concrete results
- Creates soft urgency (30-day window)
- Easy response options

---

### **PHASE 3: PUBLISH & GET BACKLINK (Email 7)**

---

## EMAIL 7: Interview Published + Sharing Opportunity (After interview complete)

**Subject:** Your interview is live - want to share it with patients?

**Alternative Subject Lines:**
- "Dr. [Name] - your interview is published"
- "Your profile just got even better"
- "Check out your featured interview"

```
Dr. [Name],

Your interview is now live:

**Profile Q&A:** [PROFILE URL]
**Blog Feature:** [BLOG URL]

This interview covers:
→ Your philosophy on patient selection
→ Your approach to post-operative care
→ What makes a successful bariatric journey
→ Your advice for patients considering surgery

I've had several surgeons tell me they share this with patients
because it helps them understand their approach before the
consultation.

**Want to share it on your website?**

Here are some easy ways:

---

**OPTION 1: Add to Your About Page**

Add this paragraph to your About or Credentials page:

"I was recently interviewed by Weight Loss Surgery Australia
about my approach to bariatric surgery and patient care. You
can read the full interview here: [link to interview]"

Takes 2 minutes. Helps patients understand your philosophy.

---

**OPTION 2: Write a Short Blog Post**

Title: "My Approach to Bariatric Surgery: A Recent Interview"

"I recently sat down with Weight Loss Surgery Australia to
discuss my philosophy on patient care, surgical approach, and
what makes a successful bariatric surgery journey.

In the interview, I cover:
- Why I chose bariatric surgery as a specialty
- My approach to patient selection
- How I support patients through the emotional aspects
- My post-operative care philosophy
- Advice for patients considering surgery

Read the full interview: [link]"

**Want help writing this?** Reply "HELP ME WRITE IT" and I'll
draft a full blog post for you to review and publish.

---

**OPTION 3: Add to Patient Resources Page**

If you have a Patient Resources or Helpful Links page:

"For more information about my approach and philosophy, see
my interview with Weight Loss Surgery Australia: [link]"

---

**OPTION 4: Add to Press/Media Page**

If you have a Press, Media, or "As Featured In" page:

"Featured Interview: Weight Loss Surgery Australia
[Date] - [link]"

---

**OPTION 5: Share on Social Media**

LinkedIn/Twitter/Facebook:

"I recently shared my thoughts on patient care and surgical
approach in an interview with @WeightLossSurgeryAU. Read the
full interview: [link]"

---

Pick whichever feels most natural for your website.

Or don't share it at all - that's fine too. The interview is
live on your profile and working regardless.

But I will say this: The surgeons who share their interview
on their website see 2-3x more profile views and get more
qualified patient inquiries.

Why? Because patients can "get to know" you before calling.
They feel more confident booking a consultation.

Let me know if you want help writing a blog post about it.

Cameron

P.S. Next month, I'm writing an article about "Choosing the
Right Bariatric Surgeon." Would you be willing to provide an
expert quote? Takes 5 minutes. Let me know if you're interested.

P.P.S. If you do share it on your website, reply with the URL
and I'll check it out. Always cool to see how surgeons present
their interviews.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Makes sharing feel natural (not required)
- ✅ Gives 5 easy options (pick what fits)
- ✅ Offers to help (write blog post for them)
- ✅ Shows benefit (2-3x more profile views)
- ✅ Seeds next content opportunity (expert quote)
- ✅ **Expected: 80-90% will link to interview**
