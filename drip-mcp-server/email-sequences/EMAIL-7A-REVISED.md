# Email 7A: One Click. We'll Call You. (REVISED)

**Day 21 | Subject:** 3 Weeks Later: One Click. We Handle The Rest.
**Preheader:** You'll receive a call within 24 hours. Exact pricing. Zero pressure.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been 3 weeks since you used our cost calculator.

You've received 7 emails from me about:
- What your gap covers
- We've verified every surgeon in {{location}}
- How people actually afford it
- Why research shows 82% long-term satisfaction
- Our 7-point verification process
- How we'll call you with exact pricing

**And you're still here. Still thinking about ${{estimated_cost}}.**

Let me guess what's running through your head:

*"It's too expensive."*
*"Maybe I'll wait until..."*
*"I should try one more diet."*
*"What if I regret it?"*
*"I don't have time to research all this."*

## Here's What I Think Is Really Happening

You're not stuck on the cost.

**You're stuck on the complexity.**

- Which surgeon should I choose?
- How do I verify they're qualified?
- What's my ACTUAL gap (not just an estimate)?
- How do I coordinate all this?
- Do I have to call 3 different practices?
- What if I make the wrong choice?

**That's overwhelming. I get it.**

---

## So Let Me Make This Stupidly Simple

**One click. We call you within 24 hours. We handle everything else.**

Here's what happens:

### Step 1: You Click

[Request consultation call →]

Takes 30 seconds. Name, phone, preferred time.

### Step 2: We Call You (Within 24 Hours)

**10-minute conversation. We'll discuss:**
- Which verified surgeons in {{location}} match your needs
- Your exact gap (we verify with your insurance)
- Payment plans you qualify for
- Timeline to surgery
- Any questions you have

**No pressure. No sales pitch. Just information.**

### Step 3: We Coordinate Everything

If you want to proceed:
- We forward your details to the surgeon's practice
- Their coordinator calls you within 24-48 hours
- They schedule your consultation
- You show up

**You make one phone call (to us). We handle the coordination.**

---

## Why We Do This

Because we realized something after helping hundreds of people:

**The information isn't the problem. The complexity is.**

You can read 100 articles about bariatric surgery.

But when it comes to:
- Verifying surgeon credentials on AHPRA
- Comparing 3 different surgeons' qualifications
- Calling your health fund to verify coverage
- Requesting consultations from multiple practices
- Coordinating everything yourself

**Most people give up.**

Not because they don't want surgery.

**Because they don't have time for that level of complexity.**

---

## What We've Already Done For You

Over the past 3 weeks, you've learned:

✅ Every surgeon on our site is AHPRA-verified (we check monthly)
✅ We've verified credentials, volume, hospital affiliations, experience
✅ We've researched gap ranges from actual practices
✅ We've identified health fund gap cover participants
✅ We understand payment plans and medical loans
✅ We have direct relationships with practice coordinators

**You have access to all of this research with one phone call.**

---

## Two Types of People

**Type 1: "I'll do more research first."**
- Reads more articles
- Adds it to their "someday" list
- Tells themselves "when the time is right"

**5 years later:** Still dealing with obesity. Still reading articles. Still thinking "someday."

**Potential costs (for those with conditions):** $15k-40k spent on ongoing treatment + 5 years of declining health.

---

**Type 2: "Let me just get exact numbers and see."**
- Requests one 10-minute call
- Gets real pricing and options
- Makes an informed decision (yes or no)

**6-12 months later:** Either has had surgery and life has changed, OR knows exactly why it's not the right time and has a plan.

**Either way: Moving forward, not stuck.**

---

## The Real Question

You've been asking: **"Can I afford this?"**

But you can't answer that with a ${{estimated_cost}} estimate.

You need:
- Your EXACT gap (not an estimate)
- YOUR insurance coverage (not averages)
- Payment plans YOU qualify for (not generic options)
- A timeline that works for YOUR life

**One 10-minute call answers all of that.**

---

## What Happens If You Wait

**Scenario: "I'll figure this out later"**

**Month 3:** Still thinking about it
**Month 6:** Tried another diet, didn't work
**Month 12:** Still stuck at the same weight
**Year 2:** Health getting worse
**Year 3:** "I should have done this 2 years ago"

**Cost of waiting (for those with conditions):** $15k-40k spent on ongoing treatment + years of declining health.

---

## What Happens If You Act

**Timeline: Make the call today**

**This week:** 10-min call → exact pricing → surgeon match
**Week 2-3:** Practice calls → consultation scheduled
**Month 1:** Meet surgeon, verify eligibility, set surgery date
**Month 2-3:** Pre-op requirements, mental preparation
**Month 4:** Surgery
**Months 5-12:** Lose 20-30kg, health improves dramatically
**Years 2+:** Maintain loss, reduced medications, better quality of life

**Investment:** ${{estimated_cost}}
**Return:** Decades of better health

---

## I'm Not Saying to Go Into Bad Debt

**Please hear me:** Don't make a financially irresponsible decision.

**If you genuinely can't afford $200-400/month:**
- We'll discuss that on the call
- We can explore longer payment terms
- Or help you create a savings plan
- Or recommend waiting and starting insurance

**There's no shame in saying "not yet."**

But at least know your REAL options, not guesses based on estimates.

---

## But If Complexity Is the Real Issue

Be honest: Is it really the money, or is it:

- **Overwhelm:** "I don't know where to start"
- **Time:** "I don't have hours to research"
- **Confusion:** "I don't understand medical credentials"
- **Coordination:** "I don't want to call 3 different practices"
- **Fear:** "What if I choose the wrong surgeon?"

**Those aren't money problems. Those are "I need help" problems.**

**That's literally what we're here for.**

---

## Your Moment of Decision

You've been stuck here for 3 weeks.

**Option 1: Close this email and keep waiting.**

Maybe you'll revisit in 6 months. Maybe a year. Maybe never.

**Option 2: Take ONE small step today.**

**One click. One 10-minute call. That's it.**

[Request consultation call →]

**You'll receive a call within 24 hours.**

---

## What Do You Have to Lose?

**Worst case:** You spend 10 minutes and learn it's not affordable/realistic right now. You've lost nothing but gained clarity.

**Best case:** You discover payment options that work, we match you with the perfect surgeon, your life changes.

**10 minutes to find out.**

---

## What This Call Is NOT

❌ High-pressure sales pitch
❌ Required commitment to surgery
❌ Complicated multi-step process
❌ Hours of your time

**This call IS:**

✅ 10 minutes of your time
✅ Exact pricing for YOUR situation
✅ Surgeon matching based on YOUR needs
✅ Real payment options YOU qualify for
✅ Honest answers to YOUR questions
✅ Coordination we handle for you

**Then you decide. Yes, no, or not yet.**

---

## Final Thought

**Research shows 82% satisfaction at 5 years post-surgery.**

Patients who have surgery don't regret the money.

**Patients who don't have surgery regret the years they waited.**

The cost is temporary. The benefits last decades.

---

Your estimated gap: **${{estimated_cost}}**
Your potential 5-year savings (if you have conditions): **$15k-27k**
Your potential: **20-30+ healthier years**

**Don't let 3 weeks become 3 years.**

---
