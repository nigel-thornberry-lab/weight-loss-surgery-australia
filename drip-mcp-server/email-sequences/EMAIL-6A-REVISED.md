**Day 14 | Subject:** Get Your Exact Gap + Payment Options (We'll Call You)
**Preheader:** No forms to fill. No practices to call. Just one click. We handle the rest.

Hi {{first_name}},

Two weeks ago, you saw an estimated gap: ${{estimated_cost}}.

But that was just an estimate based on averages.

**Your actual gap depends on:**
- Your specific health insurance coverage
- Which surgeon you choose
- Which hospital they use
- Your medical history
- Payment plans you qualify for

**You need real numbers, not estimates.**

---

## Here's The Problem

To get exact pricing, most people have to:

❌ Research which surgeons to contact
❌ Find practice phone numbers
❌ Call during business hours
❌ Explain their situation multiple times
❌ Wait for call-backs
❌ Chase up practices that don't respond
❌ Repeat the process with 2-3 surgeons to compare

**That's exhausting. And you have a life.**

## Why We Do This

**Because you're overwhelmed enough already.**

✅ Coordination with practices (so you don't have to chase)

**We're just the middleman making your life easier.**

## Why Your Estimate Could Be Wrong

Your ${{estimated_cost}} estimate could be different from reality:

**Might be HIGHER than actual:**
- Your fund covers more than standard rebate
- Surgeon has lower gap than average
- You qualify for gap cover program
- Pre-op costs included in estimate but covered separately

**Might be LOWER than actual:**
- Estimate didn't include pre-op testing ($500-1,000)
- Your excess is higher than assumed
- Additional procedures needed (hernia repair, etc.)
- Surgeon's gap higher than average

**Common variance: ±$1,000-$3,000 from online estimates**

**That's why you need the REAL number.**

## What To Have Ready For Our Call

Makes the call faster if you have:

1. **Health insurance card** (if you have insurance)
2. **Medicare card**
3. **Which surgeon(s) you're interested in** (or say "not sure yet")
4. **Any questions** you want answered

**Don't have everything? That's fine. We'll figure it out together.**

---

## Common Questions

**"Do I have to commit to a surgeon before requesting a call?"**

No. We can discuss 2-3 surgeons and get pricing for multiple. You choose after you have all the information.

**"What if I'm not ready to book surgery yet?"**

That's completely fine. Most people just want exact numbers first. No pressure to proceed.

**"Will you share my details with multiple practices?"**

Only with practices you explicitly approve. We ask permission first.

**"What if I can't afford the gap once I know the real number?"**

We'll discuss payment plans, medical loans, or alternative surgeons with lower gaps. There are usually options.

**"Is there really no catch?"**

No catch. We make a small referral fee when consultations are booked (practices pay us, not you). That's how we stay free for patients.

## Why People Avoid This (And Why That's A Mistake)

**"I'm not ready to commit yet"**
→ You're not committing. You're just getting real numbers.

**"I don't want to be pressured"**
→ We're not salespeople. We're coordinators. If you feel pressured, tell us.

**"I'm embarrassed about my finances"**
→ We talk about bariatric surgery costs all day. Zero judgment.

**"What if I can't afford what you tell me?"**
→ Better to know now than keep wondering. We'll discuss options.

**"The unknown is scarier than the truth"**
→ Exactly. That's why 10 minutes on a call gives you clarity.
