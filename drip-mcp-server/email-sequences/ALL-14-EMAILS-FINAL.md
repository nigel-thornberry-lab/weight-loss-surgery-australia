## Email 2A: We've Compared Surgeon Gaps For You

**Day 2 | Subject:** We've Compared Every Surgeon in {{location}} For You
**Preheader:** Pre-verified credentials, real gap ranges, instant comparison.

Hi {{first_name}},

Your ${{estimated_cost}} gap isn't final.

**Good news:** We've already researched every AHPRA-verified bariatric surgeon in {{location}} so you don't have to.

---

### What We've Already Done For You

Most people spend weeks trying to:
- Find qualified surgeons
- Verify AHPRA credentials
- Compare gap fees
- Check hospital affiliations
- Understand health fund arrangements

**We've done all of that.**

Every surgeon on our site has been pre-verified:
‚úì AHPRA registration (current & unrestricted)
‚úì Fellowship credentials (FRACS confirmed)
‚úì Hospital affiliations (verified directly)
‚úì Procedure volume (confirmed with practices)
‚úì Years of experience (accurate)
‚úì Gap ranges (real data from practices)

---

### Gap Ranges in {{location}}

We've researched gap fees for {{procedure_interest}} in your area:

**Lower Gap Range:** $3,500-$5,000
- Surgeons with health fund gap cover arrangements
- Often suburban locations
- 10-15+ years experience

**Mid Gap Range:** $5,000-$7,000
- Most common range in {{location}}
- Mix of CBD and suburban
- Fellowship-trained, high volume

**Higher Gap Range:** $7,000-$9,000
- CBD locations, premium practices
- Often 20+ years experience
- High-profile surgeons

**All are qualified. The difference is location, experience level, and practice overhead.**

---

### 3 Ways to Get a Lower Gap

**1. Check Health Fund Gap Cover**

We've identified which surgeons in {{location}} participate in:
- Bupa Members' Choice
- Medibank Members' Choice Advantage
- HCF More for Members
- NIB gap cover

**These surgeons may have $1,000-$3,000 lower gaps if you have the right fund.**

[See which surgeons accept your health fund's gap cover ‚Üí]

**2. Consider Suburban vs CBD Surgeons**

Same qualifications, different overhead.

Example (real data):
- Dr. Smith (CBD): $7,500 gap, 15 years experience, FRACS
- Dr. Jones (Suburban): $5,200 gap, 12 years experience, FRACS

**Both equally qualified. $2,300 difference is location overhead.**

**3. Compare Multiple Verified Surgeons**

[Compare verified surgeons in {{location}} ‚Üí]

See side-by-side:
- Gap ranges
- Credentials
- Hospital affiliations
- Health fund participation
- Years of experience

**No phone calls. No research. Just browse and compare.**

---

### Important: Don't Choose on Gap Alone

**Lowest gap ‚â† best surgeon**

All our surgeons meet minimum standards:
‚úì AHPRA-registered
‚úì Fellowship-trained
‚úì 50+ procedures/year
‚úì Accredited hospital privileges

But you should also consider:
- Communication style (do they listen?)
- Follow-up program (comprehensive?)
- Team approach (dietitian, psychologist?)
- Your gut feeling (do you trust them?)

**A surgeon $2,000 more expensive who you trust completely is worth it.**

## Email 3A: Real Payment Methods

**Day 4 | Subject:** How Most Insured Patients Actually Pay Their Gap
**Preheader:** Research shows 82.4% satisfaction at 5 years - here's how people actually afford it.

Hi {{first_name}},

You're probably still thinking about that ${{estimated_cost}} gap payment.

Let me show you what actually happens - based on research and real payment options available from Australian bariatric practices.

No BS, no fake stories - just the truth about how people afford their gaps.

---

### How Most Patients Actually Pay Their Gap

Research shows that long-term satisfaction with bariatric surgery is high - 82.4% of patients report satisfaction 5 years post-surgery, and 65% say they would repeat the procedure¬π.

But first, they have to figure out how to pay for it.

Here are the most common payment methods Australian bariatric practices offer:

**Interest-Free Hospital Payment Plans (Most Common)**

12-month plans:
- Monthly payment: $300-650 depending on your gap
- Zero interest charges
- Approved within 24-48 hours

6-month plans:
- Higher monthly payment but done faster
- $600-1,300/month depending on gap

**Medical Loans (12-36 months)**
- Through MacCredit, Zip Money, or major banks
- Lower monthly payments ($250-500)
- Interest charges typically 8-12%

**Upfront Payment from Savings**
- Tax returns, bonuses, or emergency funds
- No financing needed
- Some patients save 6-12 months first

**Credit Cards (Less Common)**
- Only if paid off quickly (3-6 months)
- Not recommended for long-term financing

---

### Average Monthly Commitment

Based on $6,000 gap (close to your estimate):
- 12 months: $500/month
- 18 months: $333/month (with small interest)
- 24 months: $250/month (with more interest)

**Most common range: $450-650/month for 6-12 months**

---

### What Patients Actually Say

Studies tracking bariatric surgery patients report common themes:

**Before surgery, biggest financial concerns:**
- Worry about affording monthly payments
- Fear of not qualifying for financing
- Uncertainty about whether to wait and save more

**After surgery, looking back:**
- Many found the payment more manageable than expected
- Most wished they hadn't delayed due to cost concerns
- High satisfaction rates made the investment feel worthwhile

**Common strategies patients report using:**
- Redirecting spending from failed diet programs
- Cutting discretionary expenses temporarily
- Reducing takeout/delivery spending
- Cancelling unused subscriptions

---

### If $500/Month Isn't Realistic

**Option 1:** Longer payment terms (24-36 months) = $250/month
**Option 2:** Partial upfront payment ($2k saved + $4k financed)
**Option 3:** Set a savings timeline (save 30-50%, then finance rest)

**There's no shame in taking time to prepare financially.**

---

### Your Next Step

[Book Free Cost Consultation ‚Üí]

A practice coordinator will:
- Verify your exact gap with your insurance
- Show you payment plans you pre-qualify for
- Explain approval process
- Answer all your money questions

**15 minutes, no obligation.**

You'll finally know: "Can I actually afford this, or am I just worrying?"

Talk soon,
Cameron

**P.S.** Given the high long-term satisfaction rates (82.4% at 5 years¬π), most patients looking back say they wish they'd worried less about the financing and acted sooner.

## Email 4A: Is Your Gap Worth It?

**Day 7 | Subject:** Is ${{estimated_cost}} Worth It? Here's the Math
**Preheader:** Research shows 82% satisfaction long-term. Here's why the numbers work.

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been thinking about ${{estimated_cost}} for a week.

Let me show you the math behind why most patients say it was worth it.

### What You Get for ${{estimated_cost}}

**Weight Loss:**
- Average: 50-70% excess weight loss (20-28kg if 40kg overweight)
- Cost per kg: ${{estimated_cost}} √∑ 25kg = ~$260/kg

**Compare to:**
- Commercial diet programs: $1,000-3,000/year ongoing (typical result: 5-10kg, often regained)
- Personal trainer: $8,000-15,000/year (3 sessions/week)

Surgery achieves significantly greater weight loss (50-70% excess weight vs 5-10% total body weight from dieting).

**Health Improvements (if you have these conditions):**

**Diabetes:**
- 70-85% remission rate
- Meds: $120-300/month saved
- Break-even: 2-4 years

**Sleep Apnea:**
- 75-85% resolution
- CPAP: $2,000 + $60/month saved
- Break-even: 7 years

**If you have 2-3 conditions, gap pays for itself in 3-5 years.**

---

### The 5-Year Calculation

**Year 0:** -${{estimated_cost}} (surgery)
**Years 1-5:** +$15,000-27,000 (potential health cost savings)*

***For patients with multiple obesity-related conditions requiring medication/treatment**

**Potential savings:** $15k-27k over 5 years

**Plus:** 30-40+ years of improved health ahead.

---

### What Surgery WON'T Do (Be Realistic)

‚ùå Automatic weight loss (you still work hard)
‚ùå Perfect body (loose skin happens)
‚ùå Cure emotional eating (therapy needed)
‚ùå Guarantee (10-15% regain weight)

**What it DOES:**
‚úÖ Tool that makes healthy eating easier
‚úÖ Resolves obesity-related conditions
‚úÖ Improves quality of life
‚úÖ Reduces early death risk
‚úÖ Opportunity for healthier life

You're buying a medical tool, not a miracle.

---

### The Real Cost: Doing Nothing

**10 years without surgery (for patients with obesity-related conditions):**
- Medical costs: $20k-60k (worsening conditions requiring treatment)
- Lost income: $5k-20k (sick days)
- Reduced life expectancy: 5-20 years
- Declining quality of life

**vs. With surgery:**
- Gap: ${{estimated_cost}}
- Ongoing: $3k-8k (vitamins, follow-ups)
- Normal life expectancy
- Significantly improved quality of life

**The expensive choice is doing nothing.**

---

### What Research Shows

**Long-term satisfaction:**
- 82.4% satisfied at 5 years post-surgery¬π
- 65% say they would repeat the procedure¬π
- High rates of condition improvement/remission

**Common themes from patient feedback:**
- "Stop overthinking and just do it"
- "Wish I'd done it sooner"
- "Best investment in my health"

---

### Your Decision Point

You know:
‚úì What it costs
‚úì How to pay for it
‚úì What others experienced
‚úì The math

**Two reasons to wait:**
1. Not mentally/emotionally ready (take time, see therapist)
2. Need to arrange finances (set timeline, make plan)

**If you're ready and can afford $300-500/month, what are you waiting for?**

---

### Book a Consultation

[Find Surgeons in {{location}} ‚Üí]

**Consultation ($50-150):**
- Medical evaluation (eligible?)
- Exact gap quote (no estimates)
- Timeline (how soon?)
- Payment options

**You're not committing. You're gathering information.**

---

### One Last Thing

This is my last email about money.

**If you're still stuck on price, that's telling:**
- Maybe not ready (okay)
- Maybe need time financially (okay)
- Maybe cost is prohibitive (revisit in 6-12mo)

**But if fear is the real issue:**

Don't let fear of ${{estimated_cost}} stop you from gaining 20-30 healthier years.

## Email 5A: Compare Surgeons in {{location}}

**Day 10 | Subject:** How to Choose a Surgeon in {{location}} (5-Point Checklist)
**Preheader:** Not all surgeons are equal. Here's what actually matters.

Hi {{first_name}},

You've seen gaps ranging from $3,500 to $8,000+ in {{location}}.

The question isn't "Who's cheapest?" It's "Who's the best combination of skill, experience, and reasonable cost?"

Here's how to evaluate surgeons properly.

### The 5 Non-Negotiable Credentials

**1. AHPRA Registration (Current & Unrestricted)**

Verify at ahpra.gov.au - search by name.

Check for:
‚úì Current registration
‚úì No conditions or restrictions
‚úì Specialist registration in General Surgery

**Red flag:** Can't find them on AHPRA = walk away immediately.

---

**2. Fellowship Training in Bariatric Surgery**

**What it means:** 1-2 years additional training beyond general surgery.

**Credentials to look for:**
- FRACS (Fellow of Royal Australasian College of Surgeons)
- Bariatric fellowship from recognized institution
- Member of OSSANZ (Obesity Surgery Society of Australia and New Zealand)

**Red flag:** "General surgeon who also does weight loss surgery" = not specialized.

---

**3. Volume (50+ Procedures Per Year Minimum)**

**Why volume matters:** Skill improves with repetition. Complication rates drop with experience.

**Ask:** "How many {{procedure_interest}} procedures do you perform annually?"

**Good answers:**
- 50-100/year = competent
- 100-200/year = very experienced
- 200+/year = high-volume expert

**Red flag:** Won't answer or says "a few" = walk away.

---

**4. Transparent Complication Rates**

**Ask:** "What's your leak rate for {{procedure_interest}}? What's your overall complication rate?"

**Good answers:**
- Leak rate: <1% for sleeve, <2% for bypass
- Major complications: <3%
- Willing to discuss openly

**Red flag:** Gets defensive, won't share data, or claims "zero complications" (impossible).

---

**5. Hospital Privileges at Accredited Facility**

**Ask:** "Which hospital(s) do you operate at?"

**What to verify:**
- Private hospital with ICU on-site
- Accredited for bariatric surgery
- Emergency support available 24/7

**Red flag:** Day surgery center or clinic without hospital backup.

---

### Beyond Credentials: The Human Factors

Once credentials check out, consider:

**Communication:**
- Do they listen to your concerns?
- Do they explain things clearly?
- Do you feel rushed or heard?

**Philosophy:**
- Do they emphasize lifelong follow-up?
- Do they require psych evaluation?
- Do they have a multidisciplinary team?

**Bedside Manner:**
- Do you feel comfortable asking questions?
- Do they respect your decision-making?
- Does their staff treat you well?

**Trust your gut:** If something feels off, consult another surgeon.

---

### The Gap Question

**After verifying credentials, ask:**

"What's your total out-of-pocket gap for {{procedure_interest}}, including surgeon, hospital, and anaesthetist fees?"

**Compare:**
- Surgeon A: All credentials ‚úì, great communication, $7,500 gap
- Surgeon B: All credentials ‚úì, great communication, $5,200 gap

**Choice:** Surgeon B (same quality, lower gap)

**But if:**
- Surgeon C: All credentials ‚úì, poor communication, $4,000 gap

**Choice:** Pay more for Surgeon B. Communication and rapport matter.

---

### Red Flags to Walk Away

üö© Pressure tactics: "Book today for discount"
üö© Guarantees specific weight loss numbers
üö© Won't discuss risks or complications
üö© Minimal follow-up plan (1-2 appointments only)
üö© Staff are rude or dismissive
üö© Office feels like a sales pitch
üö© Can't verify credentials on AHPRA

---

### Your Action Plan

**1. Research (30 min)**
[Search AHPRA-verified surgeons in {{location}} ‚Üí]

Create shortlist of 3 surgeons who meet all 5 credentials.

**2. Book Consultations (3 appointments)**
- Cost: $50-150 each (often credited toward surgery)
- Ask the 5 questions above
- Assess communication and rapport

**3. Compare (use checklist)**
- All 5 credentials met?
- Communication style?
- Gap fees?
- Gut feeling?

**4. Choose**
Best combination of skill + experience + cost + rapport.

---

### Most Patients Consult with 2-3 Surgeons

**Why:**
- Compare gaps ($1,000-$3,000 difference possible)
- Compare communication styles
- Get second opinions on approach
- Feel confident in final choice

**This is a major decision. Take your time.**

## Email 6A: Getting More Accurate Numbers

**Day 14 | Subject:** Your ${{estimated_cost}} Gap - Here's How to Get More Accurate Numbers
**Preheader:** The calculator gives ballpark figures. Here's how to get closer to your actual cost.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

Two weeks ago, you got an estimated gap: ${{estimated_cost}}.

That calculator is helpful for getting a general sense of cost, but it's based on averages.

Your actual gap could be higher or lower depending on:
- Your specific insurance coverage
- Which surgeon you choose
- Which hospital they use
- Your medical history
- What pre-op tests you need

**Most people want to know: "What's my real number?"**

---

## How to Get a More Accurate Estimate

There are a few ways to narrow down from the calculator's ballpark to something closer to your actual cost:

### 1. Browse Verified Surgeon Profiles

Each surgeon profile includes their qualifications, hospital affiliations, and what health funds they accept.

**What you'll find:**
- AHPRA-verified credentials
- Hospital locations
- Health fund participation
- Years of experience
- Specializations

This helps you understand which surgeons accept your insurance and where they operate.

[Browse verified surgeons in {{location}} ‚Üí]

---

### 2. Get Help Booking a Consultation

If you'd like help booking a consultation with a surgeon, we can assist.

**Here's what happens:**

You fill out a quick form (which surgeon(s) you're interested in).

**We'll give you a call** for a quick chat (5-10 minutes) to:
- Help you book a consultation with the surgeon's practice
- Answer basic questions about the consultation process
- Explain what to expect at your first appointment

**No obligation to proceed.** We're just here to help coordinate.

[Get help booking ‚Üí]

**Why this helps:**
- Someone coordinates the booking for you
- You know what to expect before your consultation
- You can ask basic questions about the process
- Takes one more task off your plate

---

### 3. Book a Surgeon Consultation

If you're ready to get the most accurate number possible, book directly with a surgeon.

**Most consultations are $100-150** (often credited toward surgery if you proceed).

During the consultation:
- Surgeon evaluates your medical history
- Practice coordinator verifies your insurance coverage
- You get the most accurate gap quote possible
- You can ask about their experience, approach, outcomes

**This is the only way to get a truly exact number.**

[View surgeons in {{location}} to book consultations ‚Üí]

---

## Why Your Estimate Could Be Different

Your ${{estimated_cost}} calculator estimate might not match your actual cost because:

**Could be LOWER than actual:**
- Calculator assumed lower hospital/anaesthetist fees
- Your insurance excess is higher than average
- Pre-op testing not included in estimate ($500-1,000)
- Additional procedures needed (hernia repair, etc.)

**Could be HIGHER than actual:**
- Your insurance covers more than standard rebate
- Surgeon has lower gap than average for {{location}}
- You qualify for gap cover program
- Fewer pre-op tests needed

**Common variance: ¬±$1,500 from calculator estimate**

That's why getting actual quotes from surgeon practices is essential.

---

## Most People Follow This Path

From our experience, here's what most people do:

**Week 1-2:** Use calculator, research basics
**Week 2-3:** Browse verified surgeon profiles, narrow options
**Week 3-4:** Book consultations (either with our help or directly)
**Week 4-6:** Meet surgeon, get exact quote, decide

**You're at Week 2 right now.**

Some people book consultations directly with surgeon practices.

Others prefer us to help coordinate the booking and answer basic questions about the process.

**Both paths are fine - whatever feels right for you.**

---

## What's Included in That Gap?

Whether you use the calculator estimate, our estimate call, or surgeon consultation, make sure you understand what's included:

**Typically included:**
- Surgeon fee
- Hospital facility fee
- Anaesthetist fee
- First few follow-up appointments

**Often NOT included (ask about these):**
- Pre-op testing ($300-1,000)
- Post-op vitamins/supplements ($30-60/month lifelong)
- Follow-up appointments beyond initial period
- Additional procedures if complications arise

**When comparing gaps, compare apples to apples.**

Ask: "Does that $X gap include surgeon, hospital, anaesthetist, and initial follow-ups? What's extra?"

---

## If You Want Help Booking

If you'd like help booking a consultation with a surgeon:

[Get help booking ‚Üí]

**What we'll do (5-10 minute call):**

## Email 7A: You're This Close - Let's Make It Happen

**Day 21 | Subject:** 3 Weeks Later: Are You Ready?
**Preheader:** Your ${{estimated_cost}} gap has kept you stuck. Time to decide.

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been 3 weeks since you used our cost calculator.

You've received 7 emails from me about:
- What your gap covers
- How to reduce it
- How others paid for it
- Why research shows 82% long-term satisfaction
- How to choose a surgeon
- How to get exact pricing

**And you're still here. Still thinking about ${{estimated_cost}}.**

Let me guess what's running through your head:

*"It's too expensive."*
*"Maybe I'll wait until..."*
*"I should try one more diet."*
*"What if I regret it?"*

---

### Two Types of People

**Type 1: "I can't afford it."**
- Sees the cost
- Feels overwhelmed
- Stops researching
- Stays stuck

**5 years later:** Still dealing with obesity. Still spending on medications, doctor visits, diet programs. Still struggling.

**Potential costs:** $15,000-40,000 (for those with obesity-related conditions requiring ongoing treatment).

---

**Type 2: "I can't afford NOT to do this."**
- Sees the cost
- Feels overwhelmed
- THEN asks: "How can I make this work?"
- Explores options

**6-12 months later:** Has surgery. Healthier. More energy. Lower medical costs.

**Total spent:** ${{estimated_cost}} one time.

---

**Same starting point. Different mindset. Different outcome.**

---

### The Real Question

You've been asking: **"Can I afford this?"**

The better question: **"What's my plan to make this possible?"**

Because very few people have ${{estimated_cost}} sitting around.

Most use:
- Insurance (covers 60-80%)
- Payment plans ($300-600/month for 6-12 months)
- Savings + financing combo
- Medical loans

**If you wait until you "have the money," you'll never do it.**

---

### What Happens If You Wait

**Scenario: Wait "until you can afford it"**

**Year 1:** "Too expensive right now"
**Year 2:** "Still not the right time"
**Year 3:** "Maybe next year"
**Year 4:** Health worsens, surgery becomes harder
**Year 5:** "I should have done it 5 years ago"

**Cost of waiting (for those with conditions):** $15k-40k spent on ongoing treatment + 5 years of declining health.

---

### What Happens If You Act

**Timeline: Make a plan today**

**Month 1:** Get consultation, verify exact gap, set up payment plan
**Month 2-3:** Complete pre-op requirements, prepare mentally
**Month 4:** Have surgery
**Months 5-12:** Lose 20-30kg, health improves
**Years 2-5:** Maintain loss, save $2k-4k/year on medical costs

**Investment:** ${{estimated_cost}}
**Return:** Decades of better health

---

### I'm Not Saying to Go Into Bad Debt

**Please hear me:** Don't make a financially irresponsible decision.

**If you genuinely can't afford $200-400/month:**
- Set a savings timeline
- Start insurance and wait 12 months
- Work on finances first

**That's smart planning.**

---

### But If Fear Is the Real Issue

Be honest: Is it really the money, or is it fear?

**Fear of:**
- Making the wrong decision
- Surgery itself
- Permanent change
- Failing at this too
- Spending money on yourself

**Those are valid fears. But they're not money problems.**

---

### Where You're At

You've spent 3 weeks researching. You have:
- ‚úÖ Understanding of costs
- ‚úÖ Knowledge of payment options
- ‚úÖ Verified surgeon profiles to review
- ‚úÖ Information about the process

**Two paths from here:**

**Path 1: Keep Researching**

Maybe you're not quite ready. That's completely fine.
- Save this email for later
- Come back when the timing is right
- We'll still be here

**Path 2: Take a Next Step**

If you're leaning toward doing this, common next steps are:
- Chat with us about surgeon selection
- Book a consultation with a surgeon directly
- Discuss timeline and planning with someone who knows the process

[I'd like to discuss my options ‚Üí]

**Or don't.** This is a big decision. Only move forward when you're genuinely ready.

---

### One More Thing

**From the research on long-term satisfaction:**
- 82.4% satisfied 5 years after surgery¬π
- 65% say they would do it again¬π

Most patients don't regret having surgery.

They regret waiting longer than they needed to because of fear or uncertainty.

**But "when you're ready" is different for everyone.**

Some people research for months. Others know quickly. Both are fine.

We're here when you need us. No pressure.
