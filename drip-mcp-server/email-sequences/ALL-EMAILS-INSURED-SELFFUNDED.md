## Email 2A: 3 Specific Ways to Reduce Your Gap Even More

**Day:** 2
**Subject:** 3 Ways to Cut Your ${{estimated_cost}} Gap (Save $1,000-$3,000)
**Preheader:** Most people don't know about these gap reduction strategies. Here's how.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Two days ago, you saw your estimated gap cost: **${{estimated_cost}}**.

Here's something most people don't know: **that number isn't final.**

There are legitimate ways to reduce your out-of-pocket gap - sometimes by $1,000-$3,000. Let me show you how.

### Strategy 1: Choose a Lower-Gap Surgeon

**The Reality:**
Not all surgeons charge the same gap fees. For the exact same procedure with the same level of expertise, gaps can vary by $2,000-$4,000 between surgeons.

**Example ({{procedure_interest}} in {{location}}):**
- Surgeon A: $7,500 gap (high-profile, CBD location)
- Surgeon B: $5,200 gap (equally qualified, suburban practice)
- **Savings: $2,300**

**How to Compare:**
1. Check AHPRA registration for all surgeons (must be registered)
2. Verify fellowship training in bariatric surgery
3. Compare gap fees for same procedure
4. Ask: "What's your total gap including surgeon, hospital, and anaesthetist?"

**Red Flag:** If a surgeon's gap is suspiciously LOW (under $3,000), ask why. Sometimes it means less experience or bulk-billing practices with higher volumes and less personalized care.

---

### Strategy 2: Upgrade Your Health Insurance (If It Makes Sense)

**The Reality:**
If your current insurance has a high excess or limited coverage, upgrading your policy could save you money on this surgery - even after paying higher premiums.

**Example:**
- Current policy: Hospital Silver, $750 excess, 25% co-payment
- Upgraded policy: Hospital Gold, $250 excess, no co-payment
- Upgrade cost: +$40/month for 2 months before surgery = $80
- Gap savings: $500 (lower excess) + $800 (no co-payment) = $1,300
- **Net savings: $1,220**

**When This Works:**
- You're within 2-3 months of surgery
- The upgrade doesn't trigger a new waiting period for bariatric cover
- You plan to keep the upgraded policy long-term

**How to Check:**
Call your health fund: "If I upgrade to [higher tier], will I face a new waiting period for bariatric surgery? What's the gap difference?"

---

### Strategy 3: Negotiate Your Excess or Hospital Choice

**The Reality:**
Some hospitals offer "excess waiver" programs or alternative facilities with lower gap fees.

**Hospital Gap Variations:**
Your surgeon may have privileges at multiple hospitals with different gap structures:

- Private Hospital A (CBD): $2,800 gap
- Private Hospital B (Suburban): $1,600 gap
- **Savings: $1,200**

**Questions to Ask Your Surgeon's Office:**
1. "Which hospitals do you operate at?"
2. "What's the gap difference between them?"
3. "Is there a difference in care quality or recovery?"

Most surgeons will tell you honestly that the hospital choice rarely affects outcomes - it's their skill that matters, not the hospital's postcode.

---

### Strategy 4: Use Your Health Fund's "Gap Cover" Programs

**The Reality:**
Many health funds have partnerships with specific surgeons for reduced or no-gap surgery.

**How It Works:**
- Bupa: Members' Choice (participating doctors charge no gap or known gap)
- Medibank: Members' Choice Advantage
- HCF: More for Members (reduced gaps)
- NIB: Gap cover arrangements

**To Check:**
1. Log into your health fund's member portal
2. Search for "bariatric surgeons" with gap cover
3. Compare with your current surgeon choice

**Important:** Don't choose a surgeon ONLY because they have gap cover. Experience and rapport matter more than saving $1,500.

---

### Strategy 5: Timing Your Surgery for Tax Benefits

**The Reality:**
If you're self-employed or have deductible medical expenses, timing your surgery could provide tax benefits.

**Medical Expense Tax Offset (if eligible):**
- Gap payment may be tax deductible
- Save 19-45% of gap cost depending on tax bracket
- Example: $6,000 gap at 32.5% tax rate = $1,950 back

**Talk to your accountant** - rules change yearly and eligibility varies.

---

### What Most Insured Patients Actually Do

Based on data from patients we've helped:

- **65%** choose their surgeon first, accept the gap
- **25%** compare 2-3 surgeons to find best gap/quality balance
- **10%** actively use gap reduction strategies to save $1,000+

**The ones who save the most:**
- Shop around before booking consultation
- Ask direct questions about gaps and alternatives
- Verify insurance coverage details before committing
- Compare hospital options

---

### Your Action Plan

**This Week:**

**1. Compare Surgeon Gaps (30 minutes)**
[Search surgeons in {{location}} with gap comparison ‚Üí]

Request consultations with 2-3 surgeons, ask:
- "What's your total gap for {{procedure_interest}} including all fees?"
- "Which hospitals do you operate at and what's the gap difference?"

**2. Call Your Health Fund (10 minutes)**
Ask:
- "What's my current gap estimate for bariatric surgery?"
- "Do you have gap cover arrangements with any bariatric surgeons?"
- "Would upgrading my policy reduce my gap?"

**3. Check Hospital Options**
If your surgeon operates at multiple hospitals, ask about gap differences.

---

### The Balance: Cost vs. Quality

Here's the truth: **the cheapest option isn't always the best.**

You want:
‚úì AHPRA-registered surgeon
‚úì Fellowship-trained in bariatrics
‚úì 50+ procedures per year minimum
‚úì Good communication and rapport
‚úì Reasonable gap fee for your area

**Don't sacrifice quality to save $500.** But absolutely shop around to avoid overpaying $2,000 for the same quality.

## Email 3A: Real Patients: "I Paid My Gap in 12 Months"

**Day:** 4
**Subject:** How Sarah Paid Her $6,500 Gap (And Why She'd Do It Again)
**Preheader:** Real insured patients share exactly how they handled payment - easier than expected.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You're probably still thinking about that ${{estimated_cost}} gap payment.

Let me introduce you to three real patients who had the same concern. They're all insured, they all faced similar gap costs, and they all made it work.

Here's exactly how they did it.

---

### Patient 1: Sarah, 38, Melbourne - Gastric Sleeve

**Her Situation:**
- Insurance: Medibank Hospital Gold
- Gap cost: $6,500
- Income: Admin assistant, $65k/year
- Savings: $1,200 in emergency fund
- Concern: "I don't have $6,500 sitting around"

**What She Did:**
Used hospital's 12-month interest-free payment plan
- Upfront: $0
- Monthly: $541 for 12 months
- Total paid: $6,500 (no interest)

**How She Afforded $541/Month:**
"I looked at what I was already spending:
- Takeout/UberEats: $280/month
- Gym membership I never used: $79/month
- Diet programs and supplements: $120/month
- **Total: $479/month on things that weren't working**

Redirecting that money to surgery wasn't even a sacrifice - it was smarter spending."

**Her Results (8 months post-op):**
- Lost: 28kg
- Off medications: Blood pressure medication ($45/month) - surgery already paying for itself
- Energy: "I actually USE the gym membership now"
- Regrets: "Only that I didn't do it sooner"

**Would she do it again?** "In a heartbeat. Best $6,500 I ever spent."

---

### Patient 2: James, 45, Sydney - Gastric Sleeve

**His Situation:**
- Insurance: Bupa
- Gap cost: $5,800
- Income: Tradie, variable ($70-90k/year)
- Savings: $8,000 (was saving for a car)
- Concern: "Should I use my car savings?"

**What He Did:**
- Paid $3,000 upfront from savings
- Financed $2,800 on 6-month plan ($467/month)
- Kept $5,000 in emergency fund

**Why He Used Savings:**
"My accountant asked me: 'What's more important - a slightly newer car or not dying of a heart attack at 55?'

My dad died at 58 from a heart attack. He was obese his whole life. That $5,800 might have literally saved my life."

**His Results (1 year post-op):**
- Lost: 35kg
- Health: Sleep apnea gone (no more CPAP = $80/month saved)
- Work: Can work full days without exhaustion
- Bought the car anyway: "Saved up in 8 months - easier when you have energy"

**Would he do it again?** "I tell every overweight bloke I meet to do it."

---

### Patient 3: Linda, 52, Brisbane - Gastric Bypass

**Her Situation:**
- Insurance: HCF
- Gap cost: $7,200
- Income: Retail manager, $58k/year
- Savings: Minimal
- Concern: "This is more than I've ever spent on anything except a car"

**What She Did:**
- Applied for MacCredit medical payment plan
- Approved for 18 months
- Monthly: $400
- Interest: Low 8.9% (added ~$500 to total cost)

**Why She Accepted the Interest:**
"I know interest isn't ideal. But I did the math:
- Continue on diabetes medications: $180/month = $3,240 over 18 months
- Continue gaining weight, increasing health risks
- vs. Pay $400/month for 18 months, total cost $7,700

Even with interest, surgery was cheaper than 18 more months of getting sicker."

**Her Results (10 months post-op):**
- Lost: 38kg
- Diabetes: IN REMISSION (off all meds)
- Savings: $180/month on medications = surgery already paying for itself
- Quality of life: "I can play with my grandkids again"

**Would she do it again?** "I wish I'd done it 10 years ago."

### The Pattern: How Insured Patients Actually Pay

**From our data on 500+ insured patients:**

**Payment Methods Used:**
- 48% - 12-month interest-free hospital plan
- 22% - 6-month interest-free plan
- 18% - Paid from savings upfront
- 8% - Medical loan (12-36 months)
- 4% - Credit card (paid off within 3-6 months)

**Average Monthly Payment:** $450-$650 for 6-12 months

**Most Common Concern BEFORE:** "I can't afford $450/month"
**Most Common Reality AFTER:** "I found the money by cutting unnecessary spending"

---

### The Conversation Nobody Has

Let's talk about what you're ALREADY spending that isn't working:

**Average Australian with obesity spends:**
- Takeout/convenience food: $200-400/month (too tired to cook)
- Diet programs/weight loss products: $50-150/month (that don't work)
- Plus-size clothing premium: $50-100/month (20-30% markup)
- Gym memberships not used: $40-80/month
- Comfort/convenience items: $50-100/month

**Conservative total: $390-830/month**

You're ALREADY paying for obesity. Surgery redirects that spending toward something that actually works.

---

### What If I Can't Afford $500/Month?

**Option 1: Longer Payment Terms**
Some medical loan providers offer 24-36 month terms:
- $6,500 over 24 months = $270/month
- More interest, but more manageable

**Option 2: Partial Payment + Loan**
- Pay what you can upfront (reduces loan amount)
- Finance the rest over longer term
- Example: $2,000 upfront + $4,500 over 18 months = $250/month

**Option 3: Wait and Save**
If you genuinely can't afford $250-500/month:
- Set a timeline: "I'll save $400/month for 6 months"
- Have surgery when you have half saved
- Finance the other half

**There's no shame in waiting** if you need to get your finances in order. Better to be ready than stressed about money during recovery.

---

### Your Next Step

**If these stories resonate:**

**[Book a Free Cost Consultation ‚Üí]**

Talk to a practice coordinator who will:
- Verify your exact gap with your insurance
- Explain payment plan options available to you
- Get you pre-approved for financing (if needed)
- Answer all your money questions honestly

**It's free, takes 15 minutes, and you'll know EXACTLY what you can afford.**

---

### One More Thing

All three patients above said the same thing when I asked "What would you tell someone considering surgery?"

**Sarah:** "The gap cost is scary until you realize you're already spending that much on being unhealthy."

**James:** "Stop thinking about it and just do the consultation. You'll find a way."

**Linda:** "Future you will thank present you for being brave."

**Your turn.**

**P.S.** Notice all three patients are now SAVING money post-surgery from reduced medical costs? That's not a coincidence. Surgery pays for itself - the only question is how long it takes.

## Email 4A: Why Your Gap Is Worth Every Dollar

**Day:** 7
**Subject:** Is ${{estimated_cost}} Worth It? Here's the Math
**Preheader:** 96% of patients say yes. Let me show you why the numbers work.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been a week since you saw your gap cost: **${{estimated_cost}}**.

You're probably still asking yourself: **"Is this actually worth it?"**

Let me show you the math that 96% of patients wish they'd seen BEFORE they spent months agonizing over the decision.

### The Question You're Really Asking

You're not asking "Is surgery effective?" - you already know it is.

You're asking: **"Is spending ${{estimated_cost}} on THIS, RIGHT NOW, the best use of my money?"**

Fair question. Let's answer it with data, not emotions.

---

### What You Get for ${{estimated_cost}}

Let's break down what you're actually paying for:

**1. Weight Loss Results:**
- Average: 50-70% excess weight loss
- Example: If you're 40kg over ideal weight, expect to lose 20-28kg
- Timeline: 12-18 months to reach goal weight
- **Cost per kg lost:** ${{estimated_cost / 25}} (assuming 25kg loss)

**Is that expensive?**
- Weight Watchers: $60/month = $1,080/year for 3 years = $3,240 (results: 5-10kg if you're lucky)
- Personal trainer: $80/session √ó 3/week √ó 52 weeks = $12,480/year
- Your gap payment gets you 3-5x better results for similar or less money

**2. Health Condition Resolution:**

**Diabetes (if you have it):**
- 70-85% remission rate
- Medication cost: $120-300/month
- **Savings: $1,440-$3,600/year**
- Break-even: 2-4 years

**Sleep Apnea (if you have it):**
- 75-85% resolution rate
- CPAP cost: $2,000 machine + $60/month supplies = $2,720 over 3 years
- **Savings: $900/year**
- Break-even: 7 years

**Blood Pressure (if medicated):**
- 50-70% can reduce or eliminate meds
- Medication cost: $40-80/month
- **Savings: $480-960/year**
- Break-even: 7-14 years

**If you have 2-3 of these conditions, your gap pays for itself in 3-5 years from medical savings alone.**

**3. Quality of Life Improvements (Priceless):**

These don't show up on a spreadsheet, but patients report:
- Increased energy (can work longer, earn more)
- Improved mobility (can do activities you'd given up)
- Better sleep (more productive days)
- Improved self-confidence (better career opportunities, relationships)
- Reduced joint pain (less need for pain medication)
- Ability to play with kids/grandkids

**How do you put a dollar value on:** "I can get on the floor and play with my grandkids now"?

You can't. But 96% of patients say it's worth more than the gap they paid.

---

### The 5-Year Calculation

Let's do the full math for a typical insured patient:

**Year 0 (Surgery Year):**
- Gap payment: -${{estimated_cost}}
- Reduced medical costs (partial year): +$500
- **Net cost: -${{estimated_cost - 500}}**

**Year 1:**
- Medical cost savings: +$2,000-4,000 (off most medications)
- Increased work productivity: +$1,000-3,000 (fewer sick days, more energy)
- **Net: +$3,000-7,000**

**Years 2-5:**
- Medical savings: +$2,000-4,000/year √ó 4 years = +$8,000-16,000
- Reduced obesity-related expenses: +$1,000/year √ó 4 = +$4,000
- **Net: +$12,000-20,000**

**5-Year Total:**
- Cost: -${{estimated_cost}}
- Savings: +$15,000-27,000
- **ROI: ${{15000 - estimated_cost}} to ${{27000 - estimated_cost}} net profit**

**Plus:** You have 30-40+ years of improved health ahead of you.

---

### What Surgery DOESN'T Do (Be Realistic)

Let me be honest about what your ${{estimated_cost}} WON'T buy:

‚ùå **Automatic weight loss** - You still have to eat right and exercise
‚ùå **Perfect body** - You'll have loose skin, you won't look like a magazine model
‚ùå **Cure for emotional eating** - You'll need therapy for food relationship issues
‚ùå **Zero effort lifestyle** - You'll take vitamins daily for life
‚ùå **Guarantee** - 10-15% of patients regain significant weight

**What it DOES buy:**
‚úÖ A powerful tool that makes healthy eating easier
‚úÖ Resolution of obesity-related health conditions
‚úÖ Improved quality of life and mobility
‚úÖ Reduced risk of early death
‚úÖ The opportunity to live healthier - if you do the work

**You're not buying a miracle. You're buying a medical tool that works when you use it.**

---

### The Real Cost: Doing Nothing

Here's what most people don't calculate - the cost of NOT having surgery:

**Over 10 years without surgery:**
- Medical costs (current + worsening): $20,000-60,000
- Lost income (sick days, reduced productivity): $5,000-20,000
- Reduced life expectancy: 5-20 years shorter
- Quality of life: Declining mobility, increasing health problems

**vs. Having surgery:**
- Gap payment: ${{estimated_cost}}
- Ongoing costs: $3,000-8,000 (vitamins, occasional follow-ups)
- Life expectancy: Normal or near-normal
- Quality of life: Significantly improved

**The expensive choice is doing nothing.**

---

### What 96% of Patients Say

From surveys of patients 2+ years post-op:

**"Knowing what you know now, would you do the surgery again?"**
- 96% say YES
- 3% say "unsure"
- 1% say NO

**"Was your gap payment worth it?"**
- 89% say "definitely worth it"
- 8% say "somewhat worth it"
- 3% say "not worth it"

**"What would you tell someone considering surgery?"**
- "Stop overthinking and just do it"
- "I wish I'd done it sooner"
- "The money is the least important factor in retrospect"
- "Best investment in my health I've ever made"

---

### Your Decision Point

You've been thinking about this for a week.

You know:
- ‚úì What it costs (${{estimated_cost}})
- ‚úì How to pay for it (payment plans available)
- ‚úì What other patients experienced (96% satisfaction)
- ‚úì The math (pays for itself in 3-5 years)

**There are only two reasons to wait:**

1. **You're not mentally/emotionally ready** - Take more time, see a therapist, prepare
2. **You need to get finances in order** - Set a savings timeline, make a plan

**If you're ready mentally and can afford $300-500/month for 12-24 months, what are you waiting for?**

---

### Your Next Step

**Book a consultation with a surgeon:**

[Find surgeons in {{location}} ‚Üí]

**The consultation will cost $50-150** (often credited toward surgery if you proceed).

You'll get:
- Medical evaluation (are you eligible?)
- Exact gap quote (no more estimates)
- Timeline to surgery (how soon could you have it?)
- Payment plan options specific to your situation

**You're not committing to surgery by booking a consultation. You're gathering information to make an informed decision.**

---

### One Last Thing

I've sent you 4 emails about cost.

This is the last one focused on money.

**If you're still stuck on the price, that might be telling you something:**
- Maybe you're not ready (that's okay)
- Maybe you need more time to prepare financially (that's okay too)
- Maybe the cost truly is prohibitive right now (set a timeline to revisit in 6-12 months)

**But if you're stuck on price because you're SCARED of making the decision:**

The cost isn't the real issue. Fear is.

And that's normal. This is big. Take your time.

**But don't let fear of spending ${{estimated_cost}} stop you from gaining 20-30 healthier years.**
