# Email 5A: Every Surgeon Profile is Pre-Verified (REVISED)

**Day 10 | Subject:** Every Surgeon on Our Site is AHPRA-Verified (Here's How)
**Preheader:** We verify credentials, hospital affiliations, and experience so you don't have to.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been researching bariatric surgeons in {{location}} for over a week.

You've probably noticed: **it's confusing as hell.**

- Which surgeons are actually qualified?
- How do you verify credentials?
- What does FRACS even mean?
- Which hospitals are properly equipped?
- How many procedures do they actually do per year?

**Most people just Google "best bariatric surgeon {{location}}" and hope for the best.**

**We think that's insane for a $15,000+ decision.**

---

## That's Why We Verify Every Single Surgeon

Before any surgeon appears on BariatricSurgeryHub, we verify:

### 1. ‚úÖ AHPRA Registration (Current & Unrestricted)

**What we check:**
- Current registration status
- Specialist registration in General Surgery
- No conditions, restrictions, or undertakings
- Registration expiry date

**We verify at:** ahpra.gov.au (official register)

**Red flag we catch:** If a surgeon can't be found on AHPRA or has restrictions, they don't appear on our site. Period.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Fellowship Training in Bariatric Surgery

**What we check:**
- FRACS (Fellow of Royal Australasian College of Surgeons)
- Bariatric surgery fellowship completion
- OSSANZ membership (Obesity Surgery Society of Australia/NZ)

**Why this matters:** General surgeons sometimes do bariatric surgery as a side practice. Fellowship-trained surgeons did 1-2 years of specialized training in weight loss surgery specifically.

**We verify:** Directly with RACS and OSSANZ membership databases

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Annual Procedure Volume

**What we check:**
- How many {{procedure_interest}} procedures per year
- Minimum threshold: 50+ procedures annually
- Preferred: 100+ procedures annually

**Why this matters:** Complication rates drop significantly with surgeon experience. Volume = proficiency.

**We verify:** Direct contact with surgeon's practice coordinator

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Hospital Affiliations (Current & Accredited)

**What we check:**
- Which hospitals surgeon operates at
- Hospital accreditation status
- ICU availability on-site
- Bariatric surgery accreditation
- Emergency support 24/7

**Why this matters:** Day surgery centers without ICU = risk. Accredited hospitals with bariatric programs = safety.

**We verify:** Call hospital directly, check accreditation with ACHS/AGPAL

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Years of Experience

**What we check:**
- Year of FRACS qualification
- Years performing bariatric surgery specifically
- Career procedure volume (estimated)

**Why this matters:** 15 years vs 2 years of experience = significant skill difference

**We verify:** Public records, practice websites, direct verification

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Health Fund Gap Cover Participation

**What we check:**
- Bupa Members' Choice
- Medibank Members' Choice Advantage
- HCF More for Members
- NIB gap cover arrangements

**Why this matters:** Can save you $1,000-$3,000 on your gap

**We verify:** Direct verification with each health fund's provider network

---

### 7. ‚úÖ Gap Fee Ranges

**What we check:**
- Surgeon fee range
- Typical total gap (surgeon + hospital + anaesthetist)
- Whether fees include all costs or have extras

**Why this matters:** Some surgeons quote surgeon fee only, actual gap is $2,000 higher when you include hospital/anaesthetist

**We verify:** Direct contact with practice coordinator

---
