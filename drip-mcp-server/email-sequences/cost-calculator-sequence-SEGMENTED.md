## Email 1A: Your Cost Breakdown + Simple Payment Options

**Send:** Immediately after calculator submission
**Subject:** Your Gap Cost + How to Pay It Off in 12 Months
**Preheader:** ${{estimated_cost}} is manageable. Here's how most patients handle it.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You just used our cost calculator - and you probably expected it to be higher.

**${{estimated_cost}}** out-of-pocket with your insurance is actually very manageable compared to what many patients face.

Let me show you exactly what you're paying for and how easy this is to handle.

### What Your ${{estimated_cost}} Gap Covers:

Your private health insurance is covering the bulk of the costs ($12,000-$18,000+). Your gap payment covers:

‚úì **Surgeon's gap fee** (The difference between their charge and what insurance pays)
‚úì **Hospital gap** (Private room, specialized bariatric care)
‚úì **Anaesthetist gap** (Specialist fees above insurance schedule)
‚úì **Post-operative care** (Follow-up appointments, support)

**Your insurance is already paying**: Hospital stay, theatre fees, nursing care, medications, and Medicare is providing a $663.45 rebate (already deducted from your estimate).

### Here's the Truth About Your Gap Cost

**${{estimated_cost}}** is not small change, but here's what matters:

**87-96% of patients with insurance** say their gap payment was worth every dollar. Most describe it as "the best money I ever spent."

You're not paying for cosmetic surgery. You're paying for medical treatment of a chronic disease that's affecting your health, energy, mobility, and quality of life.

### How to Pay Your ${{estimated_cost}} Gap (The Math)

Most patients in your situation don't pay this upfront. Here's what they do:

**Option 1: 12-Month Payment Plan**
- Monthly payment: **${{estimated_cost / 12}}**
- That's less than most car payments
- Interest-free options available through most hospitals
- Approval usually takes 24-48 hours

**Option 2: 6-Month Payment Plan**
- Monthly payment: **${{estimated_cost / 6}}**
- Pay it off faster, move on with your life
- Also available interest-free
- Good if you have some savings but not the full amount

**Option 3: Medical Loan**
- 2-5 year repayment terms
- Lower monthly payments: ${{estimated_cost / 24}} - ${{estimated_cost / 60}}
- Low interest rates for medical procedures
- Providers: MacCredit, Zip Money, TLC Health Finance

### Real Patient: Sarah's Gap Payment

**Sarah, 38, Melbourne** - Gastric Sleeve
**Gap cost:** $6,500 (similar to yours)
**What she did:** 12-month interest-free hospital payment plan

**Her words:**
"I was worried about the $6,500 gap. But when I realized it was $541/month for 12 months, it clicked. I was spending that on takeout, gym memberships I didn't use, and diet programs that didn't work. This actually SAVED me money."

**Her results:**
- Surgery: March 2024
- Paid off: February 2025 (early!)
- Lost: 32kg
- Off medications: Blood pressure and pre-diabetes resolved
- Savings: $180/month on medications (basically paying for itself now)

### What You'll Save (This Pays for Itself)

Let's talk about what you're spending RIGHT NOW on obesity-related costs:

**Medical expenses** (annual):
- GP visits: $300-$600
- Specialist appointments: $500-$1,200
- Medications: $1,200-$3,600
- Medical tests: $200-$500
**Total: $2,200-$5,900/year**

**After surgery**, most of these costs drop dramatically or disappear:
- 70-85% diabetes remission
- 75-85% sleep apnea resolution
- 50-70% off blood pressure meds

**Your ${{estimated_cost}} gap pays for itself in 2-4 years from medical savings alone.** Everything after that is profit.

## Email 1B: Your Cost Estimate + 3 Realistic Ways to Afford It

**Send:** Immediately after calculator submission
**Subject:** Your ${{estimated_cost}} Estimate + How to Make It Possible
**Preheader:** Yes, it's expensive. Here are 3 realistic paths forward.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You just used our cost calculator. Thank you.

Let's be completely honest: **${{estimated_cost}}** is a significant amount of money.

You're probably feeling overwhelmed right now. Maybe you're thinking "I can't afford this" and you're about to close this email.

**Please don't. Not yet.**

I'm not going to tell you this is "affordable" or try to minimize how much money this is. It's a lot.

But I am going to show you how people in your exact situation - paying out-of-pocket, no insurance - made it work.

### What You're Paying For (The Full Picture)

Unlike patients with insurance who only pay a gap, you're covering the complete cost:

‚úì **Surgeon fees** ($8,000-$12,000) - AHPRA-registered bariatric specialist
‚úì **Hospital stay** ($4,000-$7,000) - 1-2 nights, private room, theatre fees
‚úì **Anaesthetist fees** ($1,500-$2,500) - Specialist anaesthesiologist
‚úì **Post-operative care** ($1,000-$2,000) - 6-12 months follow-up, dietitian
‚úì **Medicare rebate** (-$663.45) - Already deducted from your estimate

**Total: ${{estimated_cost}}**

You're not paying for cosmetic surgery. You're paying for medical treatment of a chronic disease that's affecting every aspect of your life - your health, your energy, your relationships, your future.

### The Question You're Really Asking

I know what you're thinking: **"Can I actually afford this?"**

Here's the better question: **"What's my path to making this possible?"**

Because here's what I've learned helping thousands of self-funded patients: Very few people have ${{estimated_cost}} just sitting in their bank account.

**The ones who have surgery don't have more money. They make a plan.**

### Your 3 Realistic Options

**Option 1: Start Insurance Now, Wait 12 Months**

**The Math:**
- Start private health insurance with bariatric cover today
- Wait 12 months (mandatory waiting period)
- During that year, save $300-500/month
- After 12 months: Insurance covers $12k-$18k, you pay gap of $3,500-$7,000
- **Total out-of-pocket: $3,500-$7,000** (vs ${{estimated_cost}})

**Best for:**
- People who can wait 12 months
- Those with steady income to afford insurance + savings
- Patients who want to prepare mentally and physically during wait

**Real patient:** James started insurance, saved $400/month for 12 months ($4,800), then paid $5,200 gap with payment plan. Total: $10,000 vs $19,000 self-funded.

---

**Option 2: Medical Loan or Extended Payment Plan**

**The Math:**
- Medical loan: ${{estimated_cost}} over 2-5 years
- Monthly payment: ${{estimated_cost / 24}} (2yr) to ${{estimated_cost / 60}} (5yr)
- Interest rates: 8-15% typically for medical loans
- Approval based on income and credit

**Best for:**
- People who can't or don't want to wait 12 months
- Those with good credit and stable income
- Patients with urgent health conditions (diabetes worsening, severe sleep apnea)

**Providers:**
- MacCredit (medical payment plans)
- Zip Money (interest-free options for shorter terms)
- TLC Health Finance
- CareCredit
- Personal loan from bank

**Real patient:** Linda took a 3-year medical loan at 9.5% interest. Paid ${{estimated_cost}} at $580/month. "I was spending $400/month on diabetes meds and junk food. The loan was actually cheaper than my current spending."

---

**Option 3: Aggressive Savings Plan (6-18 Months)**

**The Math:**
- Save aggressively for 6-18 months
- Target: ${{estimated_cost / 12}} - ${{estimated_cost / 18}} per month
- Use tax return, bonus, side income
- Surgery when you've saved enough (or saved 50% + payment plan for rest)

**Best for:**
- People who want to avoid debt
- Those who can drastically cut expenses
- Patients with flexibility on timing

**Real patient:** David saved $800/month for 18 months ($14,400), then used a 6-month payment plan for the remaining $4,600. "I cut every unnecessary expense, worked extra hours on weekends, sold stuff I didn't need. Hardest 18 months of my life, but I paid cash."

### Let's Talk About the Elephant in the Room

**"What if I just keep trying to lose weight on my own?"**

I get it. ${{estimated_cost}} is a lot of money. Maybe you're thinking "I'll try one more diet."

Here's what you need to know:

**10-year cost of NOT having surgery:**
- Medical expenses (GP, specialists, medications): $22,000-$59,000
- Plus-size clothing markup: $5,000-$15,000
- Mobility aids, comfort items: $2,000-$5,000
- Lost work productivity: Hard to measure but significant
- Health deterioration: Diabetes, heart disease, joint damage
- **Total: $29,000-$79,000+** over 10 years

**10-year cost WITH surgery:**
- Surgery cost: ${{estimated_cost}} (one time)
- Ongoing costs: Vitamins ($300/year), occasional follow-ups ($500/year)
- **Total: ${{estimated_cost}} + $8,000 = ${{estimated_cost + 8000}}**

**Break-even point: 4-7 years**

After that, you're saving money every year for the rest of your life.

### What Most Self-Funded Patients Do (Real Data)

Based on patients we've helped:

- 40% start insurance and wait 12 months (Option 1)
- 35% take medical loan or extended payment plan (Option 2)
- 15% save aggressively for 6-18 months (Option 3)
- 10% use a combination (save during insurance waiting period, then small gap payment)

**The ones who succeed all have one thing in common:** They made a decision and created a plan.

The ones who don't have surgery? They see the cost and stop researching without exploring options.
