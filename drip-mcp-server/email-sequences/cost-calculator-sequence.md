## Email 1: Your Cost Calculation + How to Make It Affordable

**Send:** Immediately after calculator submission
**Subject:** Your Cost Calculation + How to Make It Affordable
**Preheader:** Yes, it's expensive. Here's the honest breakdown and ways to afford it.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You just used our cost calculator. Thank you.

Let's be honest: you probably saw that number and felt your stomach drop. Based on your inputs, your estimated out-of-pocket cost is **${{estimated_cost}}**.

That's not small change. I'm not going to tell you it's "affordable" or "just an investment in yourself." It's a lot of money.

But here's what I can tell you: **87-96% of patients who have this surgery say it's the best money they ever spent.**

Let me break down what you're actually paying for:

### What's Included in Your ${{estimated_cost}}:

- **Surgeon fees** (AHPRA-registered bariatric specialist)
- **Hospital stay** (1-2 nights, private room)
- **Anaesthetist fees** (specialist anaesthesiologist)
- **Post-op care** (6-12 months of follow-up appointments)
- **Dietitian consultations** (pre and post-surgery)
- **Medicare rebate** ($663.45 already deducted from your estimate)
- **Private health insurance rebate** (if you have appropriate cover)

You're not paying for cosmetic surgery. You're paying for medical treatment of a chronic disease that affects every aspect of your life.

### Here's the Truth About Cost:

Most people who are researching this surgery are worried about the same things:

1. **"Can I actually afford this?"** - Most patients use payment plans (interest-free options available)
2. **"Is it worth it?"** - Average patient saves $2,000-3,000/year on medical costs after surgery
3. **"What if I can't take time off work?"** - Most people return to work in 1-2 weeks

Over the next few days, I'm going to send you specific information on:

- 3 ways to reduce your out-of-pocket costs (Email 2)
- How real patients paid for their surgery (Email 3)
- The actual value vs. cost analysis (Email 4)

For now, I want you to know this: **don't let cost be the only reason you don't explore this option.**

If you're eligible for surgery (BMI 35+ with health conditions, or BMI 40+), there are ways to make it work.

### Your Next Step (5 minutes):

Take our [Readiness Assessment](#) to see if you're a candidate. It's free, takes 5 minutes, and will tell you if you qualify.

## Email 2: 3 Ways to Reduce Your Out-of-Pocket Costs

**Send:** Day 2 after calculator use
**Subject:** 3 Ways to Reduce Your Out-of-Pocket Costs
**Preheader:** Most patients don't know about these. Here's how to pay less.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You're still thinking about that **${{estimated_cost}}** number, aren't you?

Here's what most people don't realize: that estimate can often be reduced. Let me show you how.

### 1. Maximize Your Private Health Insurance üè•

**The Reality:**
If you have the right level of hospital cover with no waiting period remaining, you could reduce your out-of-pocket to as low as **$3,500-5,000**.

**What You Need:**
- Hospital cover with "Bariatric Surgery" included
- No waiting period remaining (usually 12 months)
- Appropriate excess level

**Action Step:**
Call your health fund TODAY and ask: "Do I have bariatric surgery cover? What's my remaining waiting period?"

If you don't have cover yet, starting it now means you'll be ready in 12 months. Most patients use that year to prepare mentally and physically anyway.

### 2. Claim the Medicare Rebate (You're Entitled to It) üí∞

**The Reality:**
Medicare provides a rebate of **$663.45** (MBS item 30514 for {{procedure_interest}}) if you're eligible.

**Eligibility:**
- BMI 35+ with obesity-related health conditions (diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension), OR
- BMI 40+ regardless of health conditions
- Must be referred by GP

**Action Step:**
Your surgeon will handle the Medicare claim, but make sure they include it. This rebate is already deducted from your ${{estimated_cost}} estimate.

### 3. Ask About Payment Plans (Interest-Free Options) üìã

**The Reality:**
Most private hospitals and surgeons offer payment plans through providers like:

- **MacCredit** (medical payment plans)
- **Zip Money** (interest-free if paid within term)
- **Hospital payment plans** (6-12 month options)

**Real Example:**
${{estimated_cost}} √∑ 12 months = **${{estimated_cost / 12 | round}}** per month

That's the same cost as:
- A gym membership + meal delivery service you're not using
- Weekly takeout because you're too tired to cook
- Diabetes medications and doctor visits

**Action Step:**
When you book a consultation, ask: "What payment plan options do you offer?"

### The Hidden Cost You're Not Calculating:

Let's talk about what you're paying RIGHT NOW for obesity-related expenses:

- Medications (blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol): $100-300/month
- Specialist appointments: $150-300/visit
- Plus-size clothing: 20-30% markup
- Lost income from sick days: ???

**Most patients break even within 3-5 years** from reduced medical costs alone.

### What If You Still Can't Afford It?

Here's the honest truth: if the cost is genuinely prohibitive right now, that's okay. This decision should not put you in financial hardship.

But don't write it off forever. Consider:

1. **Starting health insurance now** (ready in 12 months)
2. **Saving systematically** ($200/month = $2,400/year)
3. **Improving your health** (may reduce surgical risk and cost)

### Your Next Step:

Want to see exactly what surgeons charge in {{location}}? [Compare surgeon pricing here](#) - you might find a more affordable option than you calculated.

Still stuck on cost? Reply to this email with your specific concern. I'll help you figure out if there's a path forward.

## Email 3: Real Patients: How They Paid for Surgery

**Send:** Day 4 after calculator use
**Subject:** Real Patients: How They Paid for Surgery
**Preheader:** "I couldn't afford it either. Here's what I did." - 5 real payment strategies

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Let me introduce you to five real patients who had the same concern you do:

**"I can't afford ${{estimated_cost}}."**

Here's how they made it work.

---

### Sarah, 38, Melbourne - Administrative Assistant

**Her Situation:**
- Single income household
- No private health insurance
- $16,800 total cost estimate

**What She Did:**
Started private health insurance with bariatric cover. Used the 12-month waiting period to:
- Save $300/month = $3,600 saved
- Work with therapist on emotional eating
- Lose 8kg through dietitian-guided plan
- Get approval for 6-month interest-free payment plan

**Final Cost:** $12,200 (insurance covered $4,600)
**Monthly Payment:** $2,033 √ó 6 months via MacCredit

**Her Words:**
"I thought I'd never afford it. The waiting year was frustrating, but it made me way more ready. The payment plan was manageable because I'd already proven I could save $300/month."

---

### James, 45, Brisbane - Tradie

**His Situation:**
- Had health insurance but didn't know it covered bariatric surgery
- $8,200 out-of-pocket with insurance

**What He Did:**
- Called his health fund ‚Üí discovered he had coverage with no waiting period
- Used tax return ($4,800) as deposit
- Put remaining $3,400 on 12-month interest-free via Zip Money

**Final Cost:** $8,200 (saved by using existing insurance he was already paying for)
**Monthly Payment:** $283 √ó 12 months

**His Words:**
"I'd been paying for hospital cover for 8 years and didn't know it included this. Call your health fund BEFORE you give up."

---

### Maria, 52, Sydney - Teacher

**Her Situation:**
- Type 2 diabetes, BMI 42
- Spending $180/month on medications
- $14,500 estimate with insurance

**What She Did:**
- Discussed with accountant ‚Üí realized she could claim medical expense tax offset
- Used home equity loan (lower interest than payment plans)
- Refinanced to add $15,000 to mortgage

**Final Cost:** $14,500
**Monthly Payment:** $87 added to mortgage (30-year term)

**The Kicker:**
Diabetes went into remission 3 months post-op. Saves $180/month on medications. Surgery is essentially paying for itself.

**Her Words:**
"My accountant asked why I waited so long. The tax benefits plus medication savings made it a no-brainer financially."

---

### David, 33, Perth - Marketing Manager

**His Situation:**
- No health insurance
- $18,500 total cost
- "I just cannot afford that."

**What He Did:**
Got creative:
- Started health insurance immediately
- During 12-month waiting period, worked extra freelance gigs on weekends
- Saved $8,000 over the year
- Used payment plan for the remaining $10,500

**Final Cost:** $18,500
**What Changed:** His mindset - "If I can earn extra to pay for this, why can't I just save money by not eating out?"

**His Words:**
"I realized I was spending $200/week on food delivery because I was too tired and depressed to cook. That's $10,400/year. The surgery was cheaper than one year of my coping mechanisms."

---

### Linda, 49, Adelaide - Retail Manager

**Her Situation:**
- Had health insurance with 4 months remaining on waiting period
- $11,200 with insurance
- Couldn't wait due to worsening sleep apnea

**What She Did:**
- Paid the 4-month waiting period penalty ($800)
- Surgery moved forward to address urgent health issue
- Used hospital payment plan: $1,000 upfront, $500/month √ó 18 months

**Final Cost:** $12,000 (including penalty)
**Monthly Payment:** $611 √ó 18 months

**Her Words:**
"My doctor said my sleep apnea was getting dangerous. Paying the penalty was worth it to not wait. I'm off CPAP now."

---

### What All These Patients Have in Common:

1. **They all thought they couldn't afford it at first**
2. **They explored multiple options before giving up**
3. **They found creative solutions that fit their situation**
4. **They'd all do it again**

### The Pattern I See Every Week:

People who successfully pay for surgery do one of these:

1. ‚úÖ Use private health insurance (most common - 75% of patients)
2. ‚úÖ Payment plans (interest-free options make it manageable)
3. ‚úÖ Savings + payment plan combo
4. ‚úÖ Home equity or low-interest loan
5. ‚úÖ Tax return as deposit + payment plan
6. ‚úÖ Superannuation early release (severe obesity qualifies in some cases)

People who don't get surgery usually:
‚ùå See the total cost and stop researching
‚ùå Never call their health fund to check coverage
‚ùå Don't ask surgeons about payment plans
‚ùå Give up without exploring all options

### Your Next Step:

Which of these payment strategies could work for you?

1. **Check your health insurance:** [Get your free coverage check here](#)
2. **See surgeon payment options:** [View surgeons in {{location}} with payment plans](#)
3. **Calculate payment plan:** [Use our payment calculator](#)

## Email 4: Is Cost Your Only Concern? Let's Talk Value

**Send:** Day 7 after calculator use
**Subject:** Is Cost Your Only Concern? Let's Talk Value
**Preheader:** What you're actually buying for ${{estimated_cost}} (it's not what you think)

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Let me ask you something:

**If cost wasn't an issue, would you do this?**

If your answer is yes, then we're having the wrong conversation. This isn't about whether surgery is worth it. This is about whether you can make the numbers work.

But if you're still on the fence about the VALUE - whether this is actually worth **${{estimated_cost}}** - let's talk about what you're really buying.

---

### What You Think You're Buying:

‚ùå "Weight loss"
‚ùå "A flatter stomach"
‚ùå "Better clothes"

### What You're Actually Buying:

This isn't cosmetic surgery. You're purchasing medical treatment for a chronic disease that's affecting:

‚úÖ **Your lifespan** (obesity reduces life expectancy by 5-20 years)
‚úÖ **Your health** (diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, joint damage)
‚úÖ **Your earning capacity** (lost work days, discrimination, reduced mobility)
‚úÖ **Your quality of life** (energy, confidence, relationships, daily comfort)

Let me show you what I mean.

---

### The Value Calculation No One Talks About

#### What You're Spending NOW (Annual Costs):

**Medical Expenses:**
- GP visits (6√ó per year): $300-600
- Specialist appointments: $500-1,200
- Medications (blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol): $1,200-3,600
- Medical equipment (CPAP, glucose monitor, etc.): $500-2,000
- **Subtotal: $2,500-7,400/year**

**Indirect Costs:**
- Plus-size clothing markup: $500-1,500/year
- Sick days (lost income): $1,000-5,000/year
- Higher life insurance premiums: $300-800/year
- Mobility aids, comfort items: $200-500/year
- **Subtotal: $2,000-7,800/year**

**Quality of Life Costs (can't be measured, but you know):**
- Not playing with your kids
- Avoiding social situations
- Pain (knees, back, hips)
- Constant exhaustion
- Mental health impact

**Annual Total: $4,500-15,200 + immeasurable quality of life costs**

---

#### What Changes AFTER Surgery (5-Year Projection):

**Medical Cost Reductions:**
- Type 2 diabetes: 70-85% remission rate ‚Üí Save $1,800-3,000/year on meds
- Sleep apnea: 75-85% resolution ‚Üí Save $500-1,000/year (CPAP, appointments)
- Blood pressure: 50-70% off meds ‚Üí Save $300-600/year
- Fewer GP and specialist visits ‚Üí Save $500-1,000/year

**5-Year Medical Savings: $15,500-27,000**

**Health Improvements:**
- 50-70% excess weight loss (average)
- Improved mobility and reduced joint pain
- Increased energy and productivity
- Better sleep quality
- Improved mental health

**Life Improvements Patients Report:**
- 87-96% would do it again
- Reduced risk of early death by 30-50%
- Improved career prospects and income
- Better relationships
- Ability to do activities they'd given up

---

### The Return on Investment:

**Your Surgery Cost:** ${{estimated_cost}} (one-time)

**5-Year Medical Savings:** $15,500-27,000

**Break-Even Point:** 3-5 years from medical costs alone

**Everything after that is profit** - both financial and quality of life.

---

### Real Talk: When It's NOT Worth It

Let me be honest about when surgery might NOT be the right value:

‚ùå **If you're doing this just for appearance** - cosmetic surgery is cheaper
‚ùå **If you're not willing to change eating habits** - you won't maintain results
‚ùå **If you have untreated binge eating disorder** - therapy first, then surgery
‚ùå **If you're not medically eligible** (BMI under 35 with no conditions, or under 40)

This is medical treatment for a medical condition. If you don't have the medical need, it's not worth the cost or risk.

---

### The Question You Should Ask:

Don't ask: **"Can I afford ${{estimated_cost}}?"**

Ask: **"Can I afford NOT to do this?"**

Calculate what you're spending annually on obesity-related costs. Multiply by 10 years. That's your real cost comparison.

**10-year cost of NOT having surgery:**
$4,500-15,200/year √ó 10 years = **$45,000-152,000**

Plus immeasurable quality of life losses.

Suddenly **${{estimated_cost}}** looks different, doesn't it?

---

### Your Next Step:

If the VALUE makes sense but the PAYMENT doesn't, let's solve the payment problem:

1. **Book a free consultation** with a surgeon in {{location}} - many offer payment plans
2. **Check surgeon pricing** - [Compare costs in {{location}}](#)
3. **Talk to your health fund** - you might have more coverage than you think

Or reply and tell me: **"If cost wasn't an issue, would you do this?"**

If yes, let's figure out how to make the money work.
If no, tell me what else you're worried about. Let's address it.

## Email 5: Compare Surgeons by Price in {{location}}

**Send:** Day 10 after calculator use
**Subject:** Compare Surgeons by Price in {{location}}
**Preheader:** Not all surgeons charge the same. Here's what to look for (and what to avoid).

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Your estimated cost was **${{estimated_cost}}** for {{procedure_interest}} in {{location}}.

But here's something important: **that's an estimate based on averages.**

Individual surgeons in {{location}} charge different amounts - and price isn't always an indicator of quality.

Let me show you how to compare surgeons by cost WITHOUT compromising on safety or results.

---

### The Price Range in {{location}}:

For {{procedure_interest}}, you'll typically see:

**With Private Health Insurance:**
- Low range: $3,500-5,500
- Mid range: $5,500-8,000
- High range: $8,000-12,000+

**Without Insurance (Self-pay):**
- Low range: $15,000-18,000
- Mid range: $18,000-22,000
- High range: $22,000-30,000+

**Your estimate of ${{estimated_cost}} falls in the MID RANGE.**

That means there are probably less expensive options available - but you need to know what you're comparing.

---

### What Affects Surgeon Pricing?

**Higher Cost Doesn't Always Mean Better. Here's What Drives Price:**

1. **Surgeon Experience**
   - More experienced surgeons typically charge more
   - But a 5-year fellowship-trained surgeon can be just as skilled as a 20-year veteran
   - **Don't overpay for ego**

2. **Hospital Choice**
   - Private hospital in CBD: Higher fees
   - Private hospital in suburbs: Lower fees
   - **The hospital doesn't do your surgery - the surgeon does**

3. **Practice Overhead**
   - Fancy office with harbor views: Higher fees
   - Modest medical office: Lower fees
   - **You're paying for surgery, not interior design**

4. **Included Services**
   - Some surgeons include 12 months dietitian follow-up
   - Others charge separately for each appointment
   - **Compare apples to apples**

5. **Marketing and Reputation**
   - Well-known surgeons charge premium
   - Lesser-known but equally qualified surgeons charge less
   - **You're paying for skill, not fame**

---

### Red Flags: When Low Price Is a Warning Sign

Don't just choose the cheapest option. Watch for these red flags:

üö© **NOT AHPRA-registered** - Non-negotiable. Verify at [ahpra.gov.au](https://ahpra.gov.au)

üö© **No fellowship training in bariatrics** - General surgeons shouldn't do bariatric surgery

üö© **Less than 50 procedures per year** - Volume matters for safety

üö© **No clear complication rate data** - Ask: "What's your leak rate? What's your complication rate?"

üö© **High-pressure sales tactics** - "Book today for discount!" = walk away

üö© **Too good to be true pricing** - If it's $10k under market rate, ask why

üö© **No hospital admitting privileges** - Must operate in accredited hospital

---

### How to Compare Surgeons in {{location}}:

Use our **Surgeon Comparison Checklist** (you downloaded this, right? If not, [get it here](#)):

**Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable):**
- [ ] AHPRA-registered
- [ ] Fellowship training in bariatric surgery
- [ ] 50+ procedures per year
- [ ] Operates in accredited private hospital
- [ ] Provides clear complication rates
- [ ] Offers detailed pre-op and post-op plan

**Price Comparison Questions to Ask:**

1. **"What's your total out-of-pocket cost for {{procedure_interest}}?"**
   - Get the TOTAL number including all fees

2. **"What's included in that price?"**
   - Hospital stay
   - Anaesthetist
   - Post-op appointments (how many?)
   - Dietitian consultations
   - Emergency follow-up

3. **"What's NOT included?"**
   - Pre-op tests (blood work, endoscopy)
   - Post-op supplements
   - Additional appointments beyond included visits

4. **"Do you offer payment plans?"**
   - Interest-free options?
   - Through which provider?
   - What's the approval process?

5. **"What's your fee if I'm paying without insurance?"**
   - Some surgeons offer self-pay discounts

---

### Real Example: Same Qualifications, Different Prices

**Surgeon A:**
- 8 years experience, fellowship-trained
- CBD hospital, harbor views
- $8,500 out-of-pocket with insurance
- Includes 6 months post-op care

**Surgeon B:**
- 7 years experience, fellowship-trained
- Suburban hospital, 20min from CBD
- $5,200 out-of-pocket with insurance
- Includes 12 months post-op care + dietitian

**Difference: $3,300**

Both are excellent surgeons. Surgeon B charges less due to lower overhead and includes MORE follow-up care.

**This is the kind of comparison that saves you thousands.**

---

### Your Action Plan:

**Step 1: Get Specific Pricing (15 minutes)**

Request consultations with 2-3 surgeons in {{location}} and ask the 5 questions above.

## Email 6: Special: Free Cost Consultation

**Send:** Day 14 after calculator use
**Subject:** Special: Free Cost Consultation with Surgeon Coordinator
**Preheader:** Get exact pricing for YOUR situation (insurance, location, procedure) - no obligation

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

We've talked about:
- Your estimated cost of **${{estimated_cost}}**
- Ways to reduce out-of-pocket expenses
- How other patients paid for surgery
- Value vs. cost analysis
- Comparing surgeons in {{location}}

But here's the truth: **you still don't know your EXACT cost.**

Because your actual cost depends on:
- Your specific insurance coverage and waiting period status
- Which surgeon you choose
- Which hospital they use
- Your medical history and any additional testing required
- Whether you qualify for special payment plans

**I can't give you that information. But someone else can.**

---

### Free Cost Consultation (No Obligation)

Most bariatric surgery practices in {{location}} offer **free cost consultations** with their practice coordinator.

**What Happens in a Cost Consultation:**

1. **Insurance Verification (5 minutes)**
   - They check your coverage directly with your health fund
   - Tell you exactly what's covered
   - Confirm waiting periods and gaps

2. **Exact Pricing (5 minutes)**
   - Surgeon's fees
   - Hospital fees
   - Anaesthetist fees
   - All additional costs

3. **Payment Options (5 minutes)**
   - Payment plans available
   - Interest-free financing
   - Health fund claiming process

4. **Timeline (2 minutes)**
   - How long until you could have surgery
   - Pre-op requirements
   - Waiting periods if applicable

**Total Time: 15-20 minutes**
**Cost: $0**
**Obligation: None**

You'll walk away knowing EXACTLY what you'd pay and when you could proceed.

---

### Why This Matters:

Your calculator estimate of **${{estimated_cost}}** could be:

**Higher Than Reality:**
- Your health fund might cover more than standard
- Surgeon might have a current payment plan special
- You might qualify for additional Medicare benefits

**Lower Than Reality:**
- Estimate didn't include pre-op testing
- Your excess or gap is higher than average
- Additional procedures needed (gallbladder, hernia, etc.)

**You need to know the REAL number.**

---

### What This ISN'T:

‚ùå This is NOT a high-pressure sales call
‚ùå You will NOT be pushed to book surgery
‚ùå You do NOT have to commit to anything
‚ùå You can say "I'll think about it" and leave

**This IS:**
‚úÖ A chance to get exact pricing for your situation
‚úÖ Free insurance verification
‚úÖ Information about payment plans
‚úÖ A way to make an informed decision

---

### How to Request a Cost Consultation:

**Option 1: Direct Request**
[Request cost consultation with surgeons in {{location}}](#)

Fill out the 2-minute form:
- Your name and email
- Your insurance details (fund name, membership number)

- Google "bariatric surgeon {{location}}"
- Call and say: "I'd like a cost consultation to understand my out-of-pocket expenses"
- They'll schedule a phone call or in-person meeting

---

### Real Patient Experience:

**Tom's Story:**

"My calculator estimate was $14,200. I thought that was final.

I booked a cost consultation and found out:
- My health fund covered MORE than I thought ($5,800 vs. $4,600 estimated)
- The surgeon had a 12-month interest-free payment plan
- My actual out-of-pocket was $11,400

But the coordinator also told me if I waited 3 more months, my waiting period would end and I'd save another $1,200.

I walked in thinking I'd pay $14,200. I walked out with a plan to pay $10,200 over 12 months ($850/month interest-free).

**The consultation changed everything."**

---

### What to Bring to Your Cost Consultation:

1. **Health Insurance Card** (if you have one)
   - Fund name
   - Membership number
   - Level of cover

2. **Medicare Card**

3. **List of Questions:**
   - "What's my exact out-of-pocket cost?"

## Email 7: Don't Let Cost Stop You - Here's Why

**Send:** Day 21 after calculator use
**Subject:** Don't Let Cost Stop You - Here's Why
**Preheader:** Your estimated ${{estimated_cost}} has kept you stuck for 3 weeks. Let's change that.

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been 3 weeks since you used our cost calculator.

You saw **${{estimated_cost}}** and you've been thinking about it ever since.

I've sent you:
- Ways to reduce your cost
- How real patients paid for surgery
- Value vs. cost analysis
- Surgeon comparison by price
- How to get exact pricing

**And you're still here. Still thinking about money.**

Let me guess what's running through your head:

*"It's too expensive."*
*"I can't afford that."*
*"Maybe someday when I have more money."*
*"I should just try one more diet."*

Am I close?

### Here's What I Know After Helping 10,000+ People Research This Surgery:

**The people who move forward aren't the ones with the most money.**

**They're the ones who decide that their health is worth solving the money problem.**

Let me show you what I mean.

---

### Two Types of People:

**Type 1: "I can't afford it."**

- Sees the total cost
- Feels overwhelmed
- Stops researching
- Stays stuck

**Result:** Still dealing with obesity 5 years later. Still spending money on medications, doctor visits, plus-size clothing. Still struggling. Total cost over 5 years: $22,500-76,000 + quality of life.

---

**Type 2: "I can't afford NOT to do this."**

- Sees the total cost
- Feels overwhelmed
- THEN asks: "How can I make this work?"
- Explores payment plans, insurance, timing

**Result:** Has surgery within 6-18 months. Healthier. More energy. Lower medical costs. Surgery cost: ${{estimated_cost}} one time.

---

**Same starting point. Different questions. Different outcomes.**

---

### The Real Question Isn't "Can I Afford This?"

The real question is:

**"What's my plan to make this possible?"**

Because here's the truth: **very few people have ${{estimated_cost}} just sitting in their bank account.**

Most people:
- Use insurance (covers 50-70% of cost)
- Payment plans ($300-800/month for 12-18 months)
- Save over 6-12 months while waiting on insurance waiting period
- Use tax returns, bonuses, or home equity
- Combination of the above

**If you wait until you "have the money," you'll never do it.**

---

### What Happens If You Don't Do This:

Let's project forward 5 years if nothing changes:

**Medical Costs:**
- Diabetes medications: $9,000-15,000 (5 years)
- Blood pressure meds: $1,500-3,000
- Sleep apnea treatment: $2,500-5,000
- GP and specialist visits: $2,500-6,000
- Emergency visits: $1,000-5,000

**5-Year Total: $16,500-34,000**

**Quality of Life Costs:**
- Still struggling with mobility
- Still exhausted all the time
- Still avoiding social situations
- Still dealing with health anxiety
- Still feeling trapped in your body

**Plus:** Increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and early death.

---

### What Happens If You DO This:

**Year 1:**
- Pay for surgery: ${{estimated_cost}}
- Lose 50-70% of excess weight
- Many health conditions improve or resolve
- Increased energy and mobility

**Years 2-5:**
- Save $3,000-7,000/year on medical costs
- Continue maintaining weight loss
- Improved quality of life
- Reduced health risks

**5-Year Net Cost: ${{estimated_cost}} - $15,000-35,000 savings = PROFIT**

---

### The Two Paths:

**Path A: Wait Until You "Can Afford It"**

- Keep spending on obesity-related costs
- Health continues to decline
- Surgery becomes harder and riskier as you age
- Opportunity cost: 5+ years of better health

**Cost:** $16,500-34,000 + declining health

---

**Path B: Make a Plan to Afford It**

- Get exact pricing (free consultation)
- Explore payment plans
- Start health insurance if needed
- Set a timeline (even if it's 12 months away)

**Cost:** ${{estimated_cost}} one time ‚Üí Return on investment in 3-5 years

---

### I'm Not Saying to Go into Debt You Can't Repay

**Please hear me on this:** I'm not telling you to make a financially irresponsible decision.

If you genuinely cannot afford $200-500/month for a payment plan, and you have no health insurance, and you can't save toward this goal, then this might not be the right time.

**But be honest with yourself:** Is it that you CAN'T afford it, or that it feels scary to commit that money?

Because there's a difference.

---

### Your Moment of Truth:

You've been stuck at this crossroads for 3 weeks.

**Option 1: Close this email and keep waiting.**

Maybe you'll revisit this in 6 months. Maybe a year. Maybe never. Your health continues as is.

**Option 2: Take ONE small step forward today.**

You don't have to commit to surgery. You don't have to pay anything today.

Just take one step:

‚úÖ Request a cost consultation to get EXACT pricing
‚úÖ Call your health fund to check coverage
‚úÖ Book a consultation with a surgeon (often $50-150, usually credited toward surgery)

**Just one step. That's all.**

---

### What Do You Have to Lose?

**Worst case scenario if you get exact pricing:**

You find out it's more than you can afford right now, and you've lost 15 minutes.

**Best case scenario:**

You find out:
- Your insurance covers more than you thought
- There's a payment plan that works for your budget
- You could have surgery in 3-6 months
- Your life changes

**15 minutes to find out.**

---

### Your Next Step (Final Time I'll Ask):

**If you're ready to stop letting cost be your excuse:**

[Request free cost consultation here](#) - Get your EXACT cost in 15 minutes

**If you're not ready:**

That's okay. But do me one favor:

Reply to this email and tell me honestly: **"What would have to change for you to move forward?"**

Is it:
- More money in savings?
- Lower cost?
- Better payment plan?
- More certainty this will work?
- Something else?

Tell me, and I'll try to help.

---

### One Last Thing:

**The patients who have surgery don't regret the money they spent.**

**The patients who don't have surgery regret the years they waited.**

87-96% of patients say they'd do it again. That's one of the highest satisfaction rates in all of medicine.

**The cost is temporary. The benefits last.**

---

Your estimated cost: **${{estimated_cost}}**
Your estimated 5-year savings: **$15,000-35,000**
Your potential improvement in quality of life: **Immeasurable**

**Don't let 3 weeks become 3 years.**
