Hi {{first_name}},

You're probably still thinking about that ${{estimated_cost}} gap payment.

Let me show you what actually happens - based on research and real payment options available from Australian bariatric practices.

No BS, no fake stories - just the truth about how people afford their gaps.

## How Most Patients Actually Pay Their Gap

Research shows that long-term satisfaction with bariatric surgery is high - 82.4% of patients report satisfaction 5 years post-surgery, and 65% say they would repeat the procedure¹.

But first, they have to figure out how to pay for it.

Here are the most common payment methods Australian bariatric practices offer:

### Interest-Free Hospital Payment Plans (Most Common)

**12-month plans:**
- Monthly payment: $300-650 depending on your gap
- Zero interest charges
- Approved within 24-48 hours
- Managed directly by hospital billing

**6-month plans:**
- Higher monthly payment but done faster
- $600-1,300/month depending on gap
- For people who want it paid off quickly

### Medical Loans (12-36 months)

**Through MacCredit, Zip Money, or major banks:**
- Lower monthly payments ($250-500)
- Interest charges typically 8-12%
- Longer terms available if needed
- For people who need smaller monthly commitments

### Upfront Payment from Savings

**Tax returns, bonuses, or emergency funds:**
- No financing needed
- Avoids any interest charges
- Some patients save for 6-12 months before proceeding

### Credit Cards (Less Common)

**Only if paid off quickly (3-6 months):**
- Avoid high interest by paying down fast
- Some patients use 0% promotional periods
- Not recommended for long-term financing

## Average Monthly Commitment

**Based on $6,000 gap (close to your estimate):**

- 12 months: $500/month
- 18 months: $333/month (with small interest)
- 24 months: $250/month (with more interest)

**Most common range: $450-650/month for 6-12 months**

## What Patients Actually Say (Research Findings)

Studies tracking bariatric surgery patients report common themes:

**Before surgery, biggest financial concerns:**
- Worry about affording monthly payments
- Fear of not qualifying for financing
- Uncertainty about whether to wait and save more

**After surgery, looking back:**
- Many found the payment more manageable than expected
- Most wished they hadn't delayed due to cost concerns
- High satisfaction rates made the investment feel worthwhile

**Common strategies patients report using:**
- Redirecting spending from failed diet programs
- Cutting discretionary expenses temporarily
- Reducing takeout/delivery spending
- Cancelling unused subscriptions
- Taking on extra shifts or side work

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's what we've learned:

**Most people considering surgery ARE already spending $300-500/month on obesity-related expenses:**
- Convenience food (too exhausted to cook)
- Diet programs that don't work long-term
- Plus-size clothing premiums
- Comfort purchases
- Medical costs for related conditions

The gap payment isn't always NEW money - it's often redirected money.

**That said:** If you genuinely can't afford $250-500/month, you have options:

---

## If $500/Month Isn't Realistic

**Option 1: Longer payment terms**
Medical loan providers offer 24-36 month terms:
- $6,000 over 24 months = $250/month
- More interest paid, but more manageable monthly

**Option 2: Partial upfront payment**
Pay what you can upfront, finance the rest:
- Example: $2,000 saved + $4,000 financed = lower monthly payment
- Reduces total interest paid

**Option 3: Set a savings timeline**
- "I'll save $400/month for 6 months" = $2,400
- Have surgery when you have 30-50% saved
- Finance the rest over shorter term

**Option 4: Start insurance and wait**
- Get private health insurance with bariatric cover
- Wait 12-month waiting period
- Save during that time
- Gap drops to $3,500-$7,000 range (you're in this range already)

**There's no shame in taking time to prepare financially.**

## What Doesn't Work (Be Realistic)

**From patients who delayed or cancelled:**

❌ "I'll wait until I have all the money saved"
- Very few people ever reach this point
- Takes 1-2 years minimum
- Health often worsens during wait

❌ "I'll try one more diet first"
- If diets worked long-term, you wouldn't be researching surgery
- Average person has tried 5+ diets before considering surgery

❌ "I'll wait until work settles down"
- Work never fully "settles down"
- This is often fear disguised as timing

**Not saying these are bad reasons - but be honest with yourself about what's really holding you back.**

**P.S.** Given the high long-term satisfaction rates (82.4% at 5 years¹), most patients looking back say they wish they'd worried less about the financing and acted sooner.
