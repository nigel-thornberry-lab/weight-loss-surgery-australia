# Email Sequence Positioning Analysis

## CURRENT PROBLEM: We're Asking Too Much

### What We're Currently Asking Users To Do:

**Email 2A - 3 Ways to Cut Your Gap:**
- ❌ "Compare 2-3 AHPRA-registered surgeons with fellowship training"
- ❌ "Call your health fund"
- ❌ "Check hospital options"
- ❌ "Request consultations from 2-3 surgeons"

**Email 5A - Compare Surgeons:**
- ❌ "Verify at ahpra.gov.au - search by name"
- ❌ "Research 30 min - create shortlist of 3 surgeons"
- ❌ "Book consultations (3 appointments)"
- ❌ "Compare using checklist"

**Email 6A - Free Cost Consultation:**
- ❌ "Fill out 2-min form"
- ❌ "Google 'bariatric surgeon {{location}}'"
- ❌ "Call the practice"

### The Reality:
**They're overwhelmed, confused, and $6,000 out of pocket.**

Why would they:
- Know how to verify AHPRA credentials?
- Understand what FRACS or OSSANZ means?
- Know which questions to ask?
- Compare 3 different surgeons' qualifications?
- Navigate health fund gap cover programs?

**THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THEY NEED US.**
