## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### vs. Google Search:
- ❌ Them: Overwhelming, unverified, DIY
- ✅ Us: Curated, verified, done-for-you

### vs. Generic Medical Directories:
- ❌ Them: Anyone listed, no verification, outdated
- ✅ Us: Pre-verified only, monthly updates, current

### vs. Individual Surgeon Websites:

- ✅ Us: Unbiased, side-by-side comparison, verified

### Our Unique Value:
**"Australia's Only Verified Bariatric Surgeon Directory + Concierge Coordination Service"**

---

## CALL TO ACTION EVOLUTION

### OLD CTAs:
- "Compare surgeons in {{location}}" (vague, implies work)
- "Find surgeons" (generic)
- "Request consultation" (multi-step process implied)

### NEW CTAs:
- "View verified surgeons" (emphasizes we did verification)
- "Browse pre-verified profiles" (emphasizes we did work)
- **"Request call → You'll receive a call within 24 hours"** (clear, low-friction)
- "One click. We handle the rest." (minimal effort required)

---

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Email Platform (Drip):
- ✅ Emails 2A, 5A, 6A, 7A revised and ready
- ⏳ Need to replace old versions in sequence
- ⏳ Update Email 1A with minor positioning additions

### Website Requirements:
⏳ **Verified Surgeon Profiles** with:
- AHPRA verification badge
- "Last Verified: [date]" timestamp
- Complete credentials (FRACS, OSSANZ, etc.)
- Hospital affiliations
- Gap range estimates
- Health fund participation
- **"Request Consultation Call" button**

⏳ **Simple Consultation Request Form:**
- Name
- Phone
- Email
- Preferred time for call
- Which surgeon(s) interested in (optional)

⏳ **Backend Process:**
- Route requests to your team
- Track 24-hour response commitment
- Call script for 10-minute verification calls
- Insurance verification process
- Practice coordinator contact system
- Handoff to surgeon practices

---

## SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

Once implemented, measure:

1. **Email engagement:**
   - Open rates (should stay similar)
   - Click-through rates (should INCREASE significantly)
   - Profile views (new metric)

2. **Consultation requests:**
   - Requests per email sent (conversion rate)
   - Which email drives most requests (likely Email 6A)

3. **Call completion:**
   - % of requests where we call within 24hrs (target: 100%)
   - Call duration (target: 10 minutes)
   - % who want to proceed after call

4. **Practice coordination:**
   - % successfully handed off to practices
   - % who book consultations
   - Time from request → consultation booked

5. **Final conversion:**
   - % who have surgery (long-term metric)

**Hypothesis:** New positioning should increase consultation requests by 2-3x due to dramatically reduced friction.

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS

### Most Bariatric Directories:
1. List surgeons with contact info
2. User Googles surgeon
3. User calls practice themselves
4. User verifies credentials themselves (or doesn't)
5. User compares multiple surgeons themselves
6. **High friction, high drop-off**

### BariatricSurgeryHub (NEW):
1. All surgeons pre-verified (AHPRA, credentials, volume, hospitals)
2. User browses verified profiles (low friction)
3. User clicks "Request Call" (one click)
4. We call within 24 hours (we do the work)
5. We verify insurance, provide exact pricing
6. We coordinate with practice
7. Practice calls to schedule
8. **Low friction, high conversion**

**We're not just a directory. We're a verified directory + concierge service.**
