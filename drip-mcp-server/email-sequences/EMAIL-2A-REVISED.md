Hi {{first_name}},

Your ${{estimated_cost}} gap isn't final.

**Good news:** We've already researched every AHPRA-verified bariatric surgeon in {{location}} so you don't have to.

## What We've Already Done For You

Most people spend weeks trying to:
- Find qualified surgeons
- Verify AHPRA credentials
- Compare gap fees
- Check hospital affiliations
- Understand health fund arrangements

**We've done all of that.**

Every surgeon on our site has been pre-verified:
✓ AHPRA registration (current & unrestricted)
✓ Fellowship credentials (FRACS confirmed)
✓ Hospital affiliations (verified directly)
✓ Procedure volume (confirmed with practices)
✓ Years of experience (accurate)
✓ Gap ranges (real data from practices)

## Gap Ranges in {{location}}

We've researched gap fees for {{procedure_interest}} in your area:

**Lower Gap Range:** $3,500-$5,000
- Surgeons with health fund gap cover arrangements
- Often suburban locations
- 10-15+ years experience

**Mid Gap Range:** $5,000-$7,000
- Most common range in {{location}}
- Mix of CBD and suburban
- Fellowship-trained, high volume

**Higher Gap Range:** $7,000-$9,000
- CBD locations, premium practices
- Often 20+ years experience
- High-profile surgeons

**All are qualified. The difference is location, experience level, and practice overhead.**

## 3 Ways to Get a Lower Gap

### 1. Check Health Fund Gap Cover

We've identified which surgeons in {{location}} participate in:
- Bupa Members' Choice
- Medibank Members' Choice Advantage
- HCF More for Members
- NIB gap cover

**These surgeons may have $1,000-$3,000 lower gaps if you have the right fund.**

### 2. Consider Suburban vs CBD Surgeons

**Same qualifications, different overhead:**

Example (real data):
- Dr. Smith (CBD): $7,500 gap, 15 years experience, FRACS
- Dr. Jones (Suburban): $5,200 gap, 12 years experience, FRACS

**Both equally qualified. $2,300 difference is location overhead.**

---

### 3. Compare Multiple Verified Surgeons

**We've made this easy:**

- Gap ranges
- Credentials
- Hospital affiliations
- Health fund participation
- Years of experience

**No phone calls. No research. Just browse and compare.**

## Here's What Makes Us Different

**Other sites:** List surgeons, you do all the verification work yourself

**BariatricSurgeryHub:**
- We verify EVERY surgeon's credentials
- We research gap ranges directly with practices
- We check hospital affiliations personally
- We update profiles monthly
- You just browse pre-verified profiles and choose

**You're making a $6,000+ decision. We make sure you have accurate information.**

---

## Important: Don't Choose on Gap Alone

**Lowest gap ≠ best surgeon**

All our surgeons meet minimum standards:
✓ AHPRA-registered
✓ Fellowship-trained
✓ 50+ procedures/year
✓ Accredited hospital privileges

But you should also consider:
- Communication style (do they listen?)
- Follow-up program (comprehensive?)
- Team approach (dietitian, psychologist?)
- Your gut feeling (do you trust them?)

**A surgeon $2,000 more expensive who you trust completely is worth it.**
