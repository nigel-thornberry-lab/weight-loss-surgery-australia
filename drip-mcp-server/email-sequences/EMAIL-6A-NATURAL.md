# Email 6A: Getting More Accurate Numbers (NATURAL TONE)

**Day 14 | Subject:** Your ${{estimated_cost}} Gap - Here's How to Get More Accurate Numbers
**Preheader:** The calculator gives ballpark figures. Here's how to get closer to your actual cost.

Hi {{first_name}},

Two weeks ago, you got an estimated gap: ${{estimated_cost}}.

That calculator is helpful for getting a general sense of cost, but it's based on averages.

Your actual gap could be higher or lower depending on:
- Your specific insurance coverage
- Which surgeon you choose
- Which hospital they use
- Your medical history
- What pre-op tests you need

**Most people want to know: "What's my real number?"**

## How to Get a More Accurate Estimate

There are a few ways to narrow down from the calculator's ballpark to something closer to your actual cost:

### 1. Browse Verified Surgeon Profiles

Each surgeon profile includes their qualifications, hospital affiliations, and what health funds they accept.

**What you'll find:**
- AHPRA-verified credentials
- Hospital locations
- Health fund participation
- Years of experience
- Specializations

This helps you understand which surgeons accept your insurance and where they operate.

### 3. Book a Surgeon Consultation

If you're ready to get the most accurate number possible, book directly with a surgeon.

**Most consultations are $100-150** (often credited toward surgery if you proceed).

During the consultation:
- Surgeon evaluates your medical history
- Practice coordinator verifies your insurance coverage
- You get the most accurate gap quote possible
- You can ask about their experience, approach, outcomes

**This is the only way to get a truly exact number.**

## Why Your Estimate Could Be Different

Your ${{estimated_cost}} calculator estimate might not match your actual cost because:

**Could be LOWER than actual:**
- Calculator assumed lower hospital/anaesthetist fees
- Your insurance excess is higher than average
- Pre-op testing not included in estimate ($500-1,000)
- Additional procedures needed (hernia repair, etc.)

**Could be HIGHER than actual:**
- Your insurance covers more than standard rebate
- Surgeon has lower gap than average for {{location}}
- You qualify for gap cover program
- Fewer pre-op tests needed

**Common variance: ±$1,500 from calculator estimate**

That's why getting actual quotes from surgeon practices is essential.

## Most People Follow This Path

From our experience, here's what most people do:

**Week 1-2:** Use calculator, research basics
**Week 2-3:** Browse verified surgeon profiles, narrow options
**Week 3-4:** Book consultations (either with our help or directly)
**Week 4-6:** Meet surgeon, get exact quote, decide

**You're at Week 2 right now.**

Some people book consultations directly with surgeon practices.

Others prefer us to help coordinate the booking and answer basic questions about the process.

**Both paths are fine - whatever feels right for you.**

## What's Included in That Gap?

Whether you use the calculator estimate, our estimate call, or surgeon consultation, make sure you understand what's included:

**Typically included:**
- Surgeon fee
- Hospital facility fee
- Anaesthetist fee
- First few follow-up appointments

**Often NOT included (ask about these):**
- Pre-op testing ($300-1,000)
- Post-op vitamins/supplements ($30-60/month lifelong)
- Follow-up appointments beyond initial period
- Additional procedures if complications arise

**When comparing gaps, compare apples to apples.**

Ask: "Does that $X gap include surgeon, hospital, anaesthetist, and initial follow-ups? What's extra?"
