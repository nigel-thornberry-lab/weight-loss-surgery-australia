## Email 2A: We've Compared Surgeon Gaps For You

**Day 2 | Subject:** We've Compared Every Surgeon in {{location}} For You
**Preheader:** Pre-verified credentials, real gap ranges, instant comparison.

Hi {{first_name}},

Your ${{estimated_cost}} gap isn't final.

**Good news:** We've already researched every AHPRA-verified bariatric surgeon in {{location}} so you don't have to.

---

### What We've Already Done For You

Most people spend weeks trying to:
- Find qualified surgeons
- Verify AHPRA credentials
- Compare gap fees
- Check hospital affiliations
- Understand health fund arrangements

**We've done all of that.**

Every surgeon on our site has been pre-verified:
✓ AHPRA registration (current & unrestricted)
✓ Fellowship credentials (FRACS confirmed)
✓ Hospital affiliations (verified directly)
✓ Procedure volume (confirmed with practices)
✓ Years of experience (accurate)
✓ Gap ranges (real data from practices)

---

### Gap Ranges in {{location}}

We've researched gap fees for {{procedure_interest}} in your area:

**Lower Gap Range:** $3,500-$5,000
- Surgeons with health fund gap cover arrangements
- Often suburban locations
- 10-15+ years experience

**Mid Gap Range:** $5,000-$7,000
- Most common range in {{location}}
- Mix of CBD and suburban
- Fellowship-trained, high volume

**Higher Gap Range:** $7,000-$9,000
- CBD locations, premium practices
- Often 20+ years experience
- High-profile surgeons

**All are qualified. The difference is location, experience level, and practice overhead.**

---

### 3 Ways to Get a Lower Gap

**1. Check Health Fund Gap Cover**

We've identified which surgeons in {{location}} participate in:
- Bupa Members' Choice
- Medibank Members' Choice Advantage
- HCF More for Members
- NIB gap cover

**These surgeons may have $1,000-$3,000 lower gaps if you have the right fund.**

[See which surgeons accept your health fund's gap cover →]

**2. Consider Suburban vs CBD Surgeons**

Same qualifications, different overhead.

Example (real data):
- Dr. Smith (CBD): $7,500 gap, 15 years experience, FRACS
- Dr. Jones (Suburban): $5,200 gap, 12 years experience, FRACS

**Both equally qualified. $2,300 difference is location overhead.**

**3. Compare Multiple Verified Surgeons**

[Compare verified surgeons in {{location}} →]

See side-by-side:
- Gap ranges
- Credentials
- Hospital affiliations
- Health fund participation
- Years of experience

**No phone calls. No research. Just browse and compare.**

---

### Important: Don't Choose on Gap Alone

**Lowest gap ≠ best surgeon**

All our surgeons meet minimum standards:
✓ AHPRA-registered
✓ Fellowship-trained
✓ 50+ procedures/year
✓ Accredited hospital privileges

But you should also consider:
- Communication style (do they listen?)
- Follow-up program (comprehensive?)
- Team approach (dietitian, psychologist?)
- Your gut feeling (do you trust them?)

**A surgeon $2,000 more expensive who you trust completely is worth it.**

## Email 3A: Real Payment Methods

**Day 4 | Subject:** How Most Insured Patients Actually Pay Their Gap
**Preheader:** Research shows 82.4% satisfaction at 5 years - here's how people actually afford it.

Hi {{first_name}},

You're probably still thinking about that ${{estimated_cost}} gap payment.

Let me show you what actually happens - based on research and real payment options available from Australian bariatric practices.

No BS, no fake stories - just the truth about how people afford their gaps.

---

### How Most Patients Actually Pay Their Gap

Research shows that long-term satisfaction with bariatric surgery is high - 82.4% of patients report satisfaction 5 years post-surgery, and 65% say they would repeat the procedure¹.

But first, they have to figure out how to pay for it.

Here are the most common payment methods Australian bariatric practices offer:

**Interest-Free Hospital Payment Plans (Most Common)**

12-month plans:
- Monthly payment: $300-650 depending on your gap
- Zero interest charges
- Approved within 24-48 hours

6-month plans:
- Higher monthly payment but done faster
- $600-1,300/month depending on gap

**Medical Loans (12-36 months)**
- Through MacCredit, Zip Money, or major banks
- Lower monthly payments ($250-500)
- Interest charges typically 8-12%

**Upfront Payment from Savings**
- Tax returns, bonuses, or emergency funds
- No financing needed
- Some patients save 6-12 months first

**Credit Cards (Less Common)**
- Only if paid off quickly (3-6 months)
- Not recommended for long-term financing

---

### Average Monthly Commitment

Based on $6,000 gap (close to your estimate):
- 12 months: $500/month
- 18 months: $333/month (with small interest)
- 24 months: $250/month (with more interest)

**Most common range: $450-650/month for 6-12 months**

---

### What Patients Actually Say

Studies tracking bariatric surgery patients report common themes:

**Before surgery, biggest financial concerns:**
- Worry about affording monthly payments
- Fear of not qualifying for financing
- Uncertainty about whether to wait and save more

**After surgery, looking back:**
- Many found the payment more manageable than expected
- Most wished they hadn't delayed due to cost concerns
- High satisfaction rates made the investment feel worthwhile

**Common strategies patients report using:**
- Redirecting spending from failed diet programs
- Cutting discretionary expenses temporarily
- Reducing takeout/delivery spending
- Cancelling unused subscriptions

---

### If $500/Month Isn't Realistic

**Option 1:** Longer payment terms (24-36 months) = $250/month
**Option 2:** Partial upfront payment ($2k saved + $4k financed)
**Option 3:** Set a savings timeline (save 30-50%, then finance rest)

**There's no shame in taking time to prepare financially.**

---

### Your Next Step

[Book Free Cost Consultation →]

A practice coordinator will:
- Verify your exact gap with your insurance
- Show you payment plans you pre-qualify for
- Explain approval process
- Answer all your money questions

**15 minutes, no obligation.**

You'll finally know: "Can I actually afford this, or am I just worrying?"

Talk soon,
Cameron

**P.S.** Given the high long-term satisfaction rates (82.4% at 5 years¹), most patients looking back say they wish they'd worried less about the financing and acted sooner.

## Email 4A: Is Your Gap Worth It?

**Day 7 | Subject:** Is ${{estimated_cost}} Worth It? Here's the Math
**Preheader:** Research shows 82% satisfaction long-term. Here's why the numbers work.

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been thinking about ${{estimated_cost}} for a week.

Let me show you the math behind why most patients say it was worth it.

### What You Get for ${{estimated_cost}}

**Weight Loss:**
- Average: 50-70% excess weight loss (20-28kg if 40kg overweight)
- Cost per kg: ${{estimated_cost}} ÷ 25kg = ~$260/kg

**Compare to:**
- Commercial diet programs: $1,000-3,000/year ongoing (typical result: 5-10kg, often regained)
- Personal trainer: $8,000-15,000/year (3 sessions/week)

Surgery achieves significantly greater weight loss (50-70% excess weight vs 5-10% total body weight from dieting).

**Health Improvements (if you have these conditions):**

**Diabetes:**
- 70-85% remission rate
- Meds: $120-300/month saved
- Break-even: 2-4 years

**Sleep Apnea:**
- 75-85% resolution
- CPAP: $2,000 + $60/month saved
- Break-even: 7 years

**If you have 2-3 conditions, gap pays for itself in 3-5 years.**

---

### The 5-Year Calculation

**Year 0:** -${{estimated_cost}} (surgery)
**Years 1-5:** +$15,000-27,000 (potential health cost savings)*

***For patients with multiple obesity-related conditions requiring medication/treatment**

**Potential savings:** $15k-27k over 5 years

**Plus:** 30-40+ years of improved health ahead.

---

### What Surgery WON'T Do (Be Realistic)

❌ Automatic weight loss (you still work hard)
❌ Perfect body (loose skin happens)
❌ Cure emotional eating (therapy needed)
❌ Guarantee (10-15% regain weight)

**What it DOES:**
✅ Tool that makes healthy eating easier
✅ Resolves obesity-related conditions
✅ Improves quality of life
✅ Reduces early death risk
✅ Opportunity for healthier life

You're buying a medical tool, not a miracle.

---

### The Real Cost: Doing Nothing

**10 years without surgery (for patients with obesity-related conditions):**
- Medical costs: $20k-60k (worsening conditions requiring treatment)
- Lost income: $5k-20k (sick days)
- Reduced life expectancy: 5-20 years
- Declining quality of life

**vs. With surgery:**
- Gap: ${{estimated_cost}}
- Ongoing: $3k-8k (vitamins, follow-ups)
- Normal life expectancy
- Significantly improved quality of life

**The expensive choice is doing nothing.**

---

### What Research Shows

**Long-term satisfaction:**
- 82.4% satisfied at 5 years post-surgery¹
- 65% say they would repeat the procedure¹
- High rates of condition improvement/remission

**Common themes from patient feedback:**
- "Stop overthinking and just do it"
- "Wish I'd done it sooner"
- "Best investment in my health"

---

### Your Decision Point

You know:
✓ What it costs
✓ How to pay for it
✓ What others experienced
✓ The math

**Two reasons to wait:**
1. Not mentally/emotionally ready (take time, see therapist)
2. Need to arrange finances (set timeline, make plan)

**If you're ready and can afford $300-500/month, what are you waiting for?**

---

### Book a Consultation

[Find Surgeons in {{location}} →]

**Consultation ($50-150):**
- Medical evaluation (eligible?)
- Exact gap quote (no estimates)
- Timeline (how soon?)
- Payment options

**You're not committing. You're gathering information.**

---

### One Last Thing

This is my last email about money.

**If you're still stuck on price, that's telling:**
- Maybe not ready (okay)
- Maybe need time financially (okay)
- Maybe cost is prohibitive (revisit in 6-12mo)

**But if fear is the real issue:**

Don't let fear of ${{estimated_cost}} stop you from gaining 20-30 healthier years.

## Email 5A: Compare Surgeons in {{location}}

**Day 10 | Subject:** How to Choose a Surgeon in {{location}} (5-Point Checklist)
**Preheader:** Not all surgeons are equal. Here's what actually matters.

Hi {{first_name}},

You've seen gaps ranging from $3,500 to $8,000+ in {{location}}.

The question isn't "Who's cheapest?" It's "Who's the best combination of skill, experience, and reasonable cost?"

Here's how to evaluate surgeons properly.

### The 5 Non-Negotiable Credentials

**1. AHPRA Registration (Current & Unrestricted)**

Verify at ahpra.gov.au - search by name.

Check for:
✓ Current registration
✓ No conditions or restrictions
✓ Specialist registration in General Surgery

**Red flag:** Can't find them on AHPRA = walk away immediately.

---

**2. Fellowship Training in Bariatric Surgery**

**What it means:** 1-2 years additional training beyond general surgery.

**Credentials to look for:**
- FRACS (Fellow of Royal Australasian College of Surgeons)
- Bariatric fellowship from recognized institution
- Member of OSSANZ (Obesity Surgery Society of Australia and New Zealand)

**Red flag:** "General surgeon who also does weight loss surgery" = not specialized.

---

**3. Volume (50+ Procedures Per Year Minimum)**

**Why volume matters:** Skill improves with repetition. Complication rates drop with experience.

**Ask:** "How many {{procedure_interest}} procedures do you perform annually?"

**Good answers:**
- 50-100/year = competent
- 100-200/year = very experienced
- 200+/year = high-volume expert

**Red flag:** Won't answer or says "a few" = walk away.

---

**4. Transparent Complication Rates**

**Ask:** "What's your leak rate for {{procedure_interest}}? What's your overall complication rate?"

**Good answers:**
- Leak rate: <1% for sleeve, <2% for bypass
- Major complications: <3%
- Willing to discuss openly

**Red flag:** Gets defensive, won't share data, or claims "zero complications" (impossible).

---

**5. Hospital Privileges at Accredited Facility**

**Ask:** "Which hospital(s) do you operate at?"

**What to verify:**
- Private hospital with ICU on-site
- Accredited for bariatric surgery
- Emergency support available 24/7

**Red flag:** Day surgery center or clinic without hospital backup.

---

### Beyond Credentials: The Human Factors

Once credentials check out, consider:

**Communication:**
- Do they listen to your concerns?
- Do they explain things clearly?
- Do you feel rushed or heard?

**Philosophy:**
- Do they emphasize lifelong follow-up?
- Do they require psych evaluation?
- Do they have a multidisciplinary team?

**Bedside Manner:**
- Do you feel comfortable asking questions?
- Do they respect your decision-making?
- Does their staff treat you well?

**Trust your gut:** If something feels off, consult another surgeon.

---

### The Gap Question

**After verifying credentials, ask:**

"What's your total out-of-pocket gap for {{procedure_interest}}, including surgeon, hospital, and anaesthetist fees?"

**Compare:**
- Surgeon A: All credentials ✓, great communication, $7,500 gap
- Surgeon B: All credentials ✓, great communication, $5,200 gap

**Choice:** Surgeon B (same quality, lower gap)

**But if:**
- Surgeon C: All credentials ✓, poor communication, $4,000 gap

**Choice:** Pay more for Surgeon B. Communication and rapport matter.

---

### Red Flags to Walk Away

🚩 Pressure tactics: "Book today for discount"
🚩 Guarantees specific weight loss numbers
🚩 Won't discuss risks or complications
🚩 Minimal follow-up plan (1-2 appointments only)
🚩 Staff are rude or dismissive
🚩 Office feels like a sales pitch
🚩 Can't verify credentials on AHPRA

---

### Your Action Plan

**1. Research (30 min)**
[Search AHPRA-verified surgeons in {{location}} →]

Create shortlist of 3 surgeons who meet all 5 credentials.

**2. Book Consultations (3 appointments)**
- Cost: $50-150 each (often credited toward surgery)
- Ask the 5 questions above
- Assess communication and rapport

**3. Compare (use checklist)**
- All 5 credentials met?
- Communication style?
- Gap fees?
- Gut feeling?

**4. Choose**
Best combination of skill + experience + cost + rapport.

---

### Most Patients Consult with 2-3 Surgeons

**Why:**
- Compare gaps ($1,000-$3,000 difference possible)
- Compare communication styles
- Get second opinions on approach
- Feel confident in final choice

**This is a major decision. Take your time.**

## Email 6A: Free Cost Consultation Offer

**Day 14 | Subject:** Get Your Exact Gap + Payment Approval (Free, 15 Min)
**Preheader:** Stop guessing. Get real numbers from a practice coordinator.

Hi {{first_name}},

Two weeks ago, you saw an estimated gap: ${{estimated_cost}}.

But that was an estimate based on averages.

Your ACTUAL gap depends on:
- Your specific insurance coverage
- Which surgeon you choose
- Which hospital they use
- Your medical history
- Payment plans you qualify for

**Want to know your exact numbers?**

### Free Cost Consultation (No Obligation)

Most bariatric practices in {{location}} offer free consultations with practice coordinators.

**What happens (15-20 min):**

**1. Insurance Verification**
They call your health fund and verify:
- Your exact coverage for bariatric surgery
- Waiting periods (complete or remaining)
- Your gap estimate with that surgeon

**2. Exact Pricing**
They provide:
- Surgeon fees
- Hospital fees
- Anaesthetist fees
- Total out-of-pocket

**3. Payment Options**
They explain:
- Interest-free payment plans (6-12 months)
- Medical loan options (12-36 months)
- What you pre-qualify for

**4. Timeline**
They tell you:
- How soon you could have surgery
- Pre-op requirements
- Waiting periods if applicable

**Total time:** 15-20 minutes
**Cost:** $0
**Obligation:** None

---

### Why This Matters

Your ${{estimated_cost}} estimate could be different from reality:

**Might be HIGHER than actual:**
- Your fund covers more than standard rebate
- Surgeon has lower gap than average
- You qualify for gap cover program
- Pre-op costs included in estimate but covered separately

**Might be LOWER than actual:**
- Estimate didn't include pre-op testing ($500-1,000)
- Your excess is higher than assumed
- Additional procedures needed (hernia repair, etc.)
- Surgeon's gap higher than average

Online estimates are just that - estimates based on averages. Your actual cost depends on your specific situation.

**You need the REAL number, not a guess.**

---

### What This Isn't

❌ High-pressure sales call
❌ Required commitment to surgery
❌ Pushy booking tactics

**This IS:**
✅ Information gathering
✅ Free insurance verification
✅ Real payment plan options
✅ Informed decision-making

You can say "I'll think about it" and leave. No pressure.

---

### Why People Avoid This Call (And Why That's a Mistake)

**Common excuses:**

**"I'm not ready to commit yet"**
→ You're not committing. You're gathering information.

**"I don't want to be pressured"**
→ Legitimate practices don't pressure. If they do, walk away.

**"I'm embarrassed about my finances"**
→ Coordinators deal with this all day. No judgment.

**"What if I can't afford what they tell me?"**
→ Better to know now than keep wondering.

**The reality:** Most people who finally make this call say, "I should have done this weeks ago."

---

### How to Request Cost Consultation

**Option 1: Direct Request**
[Request consultation with surgeons in {{location}} →]

Fill out 2-min form:
- Name, email, phone
- Insurance details
- Preferred procedure
- Best time to call

They contact you within 1 business day.

**Option 2: Book Surgeon Consultation**
[View surgeons in {{location}} →]

Many include cost consultation in initial appointment. You meet surgeon AND get exact pricing.

**Option 3: Call Directly**
Google "bariatric surgeon {{location}}" → Call practice → Say: "I'd like a cost consultation to understand out-of-pocket expenses"

---

### What to Bring

1. **Health insurance card** (if you have one)
2. **Medicare card**
3. **Questions list:**
   - What's my exact out-of-pocket?
   - What payment plans exist?
   - When could I have surgery?
   - What's included vs. extra costs?
4. **Your calculator results** (${{estimated_cost}} estimate)

---

### This Is Your Crossroads

You've been researching for 2 weeks.

You know:
✓ What it costs (estimate)
✓ How to pay (options)
✓ How others afforded it
✓ What you're getting

**What you DON'T know:**
❌ Your EXACT cost
❌ Your SPECIFIC payment options
❌ Your ACTUAL timeline

**A 15-min consultation answers all three.**

---

### If You're Serious About This

You'll get:
✓ Exact pricing for YOUR situation

## Email 7A: You're This Close - Let's Make It Happen

**Day 21 | Subject:** 3 Weeks Later: Are You Ready?
**Preheader:** Your ${{estimated_cost}} gap has kept you stuck. Time to decide.

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been 3 weeks since you used our cost calculator.

You've received 7 emails from me about:
- What your gap covers
- How to reduce it
- How others paid for it
- Why research shows 82% long-term satisfaction
- How to choose a surgeon
- How to get exact pricing

**And you're still here. Still thinking about ${{estimated_cost}}.**

Let me guess what's running through your head:

*"It's too expensive."*
*"Maybe I'll wait until..."*
*"I should try one more diet."*
*"What if I regret it?"*

---

### Two Types of People

**Type 1: "I can't afford it."**
- Sees the cost
- Feels overwhelmed
- Stops researching
- Stays stuck

**5 years later:** Still dealing with obesity. Still spending on medications, doctor visits, diet programs. Still struggling.

**Potential costs:** $15,000-40,000 (for those with obesity-related conditions requiring ongoing treatment).

---

**Type 2: "I can't afford NOT to do this."**
- Sees the cost
- Feels overwhelmed
- THEN asks: "How can I make this work?"
- Explores options

**6-12 months later:** Has surgery. Healthier. More energy. Lower medical costs.

**Total spent:** ${{estimated_cost}} one time.

---

**Same starting point. Different mindset. Different outcome.**

---

### The Real Question

You've been asking: **"Can I afford this?"**

The better question: **"What's my plan to make this possible?"**

Because very few people have ${{estimated_cost}} sitting around.

Most use:
- Insurance (covers 60-80%)
- Payment plans ($300-600/month for 6-12 months)
- Savings + financing combo
- Medical loans

**If you wait until you "have the money," you'll never do it.**

---

### What Happens If You Wait

**Scenario: Wait "until you can afford it"**

**Year 1:** "Too expensive right now"
**Year 2:** "Still not the right time"
**Year 3:** "Maybe next year"
**Year 4:** Health worsens, surgery becomes harder
**Year 5:** "I should have done it 5 years ago"

**Cost of waiting (for those with conditions):** $15k-40k spent on ongoing treatment + 5 years of declining health.

---

### What Happens If You Act

**Timeline: Make a plan today**

**Month 1:** Get consultation, verify exact gap, set up payment plan
**Month 2-3:** Complete pre-op requirements, prepare mentally
**Month 4:** Have surgery
**Months 5-12:** Lose 20-30kg, health improves
**Years 2-5:** Maintain loss, save $2k-4k/year on medical costs

**Investment:** ${{estimated_cost}}
**Return:** Decades of better health

---

### I'm Not Saying to Go Into Bad Debt

**Please hear me:** Don't make a financially irresponsible decision.

**If you genuinely can't afford $200-400/month:**
- Set a savings timeline
- Start insurance and wait 12 months
- Work on finances first

**That's smart planning.**

---

### But If Fear Is the Real Issue

Be honest: Is it really the money, or is it fear?

**Fear of:**
- Making the wrong decision
- Surgery itself
- Permanent change
- Failing at this too
- Spending money on yourself

**Those are valid fears. But they're not money problems.**

---

### Your Moment of Decision

You've been stuck here for 3 weeks.

**Option 1: Close this email and keep waiting.**

Maybe you'll revisit in 6 months. Maybe a year. Maybe never.

**Option 2: Take ONE small step today.**

You don't have to commit to surgery.

Just:
✅ Request a cost consultation (15 min, get exact numbers)
✅ OR book a surgeon consultation ($50-150)
✅ OR call your health fund (check coverage)

**One step. That's all.**

---

### What Do You Have to Lose?

**Worst case:** You spend 15 minutes and learn it's not affordable right now. You've lost nothing.

**Best case:** You discover payment options that work, you move forward, your life changes.

**15 minutes to find out.**

---

### Final Thought

**Patients who have surgery don't regret the money.**

**Patients who don't have surgery regret the years they waited.**

87-96% satisfaction rate. One of the highest in all of medicine.

**The cost is temporary. The benefits last.**

---

Your gap: **${{estimated_cost}}**
Your 5-year savings: **$15,000-27,000**
Your potential: **20-30+ healthier years**

**Don't let 3 weeks become 3 years.**
