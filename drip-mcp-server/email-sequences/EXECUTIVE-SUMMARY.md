# Email Sequence Revision - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## üéØ WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### The Problem You Identified:
> "They're making a $15,000+ decision based on incomplete information. I built you a verified profile that consolidates everything: AHPRA-verified credentials, all hospital affiliations, professional memberships, years of experience, specializations."

**But our emails weren't positioning this value correctly.**

We were asking users to:
- ‚ùå Verify AHPRA themselves
- ‚ùå Call their health fund
- ‚ùå Research 3 surgeons
- ‚ùå Book consultations themselves
- ‚ùå Do hours of work

**When we should have been saying:**
- ‚úÖ We've verified every surgeon
- ‚úÖ We've researched gaps
- ‚úÖ Click once, we'll call you within 24 hours
- ‚úÖ We handle everything

---

## üìß WHAT CHANGED

### 4 Emails Completely Rewritten:

1. **Email 2A** (Day 2): "We've Compared Surgeon Gaps For You"
2. **Email 5A** (Day 10): "Every Surgeon Profile is Pre-Verified"
3. **Email 6A** (Day 14): "We'll Call You With Exact Pricing"
4. **Email 7A** (Day 21): "One Click. We'll Call You."

### Core Positioning Shift:

**Before:** "Here's how to do research yourself"
**After:** "We did the research. You'll receive a call within 24 hours."

---

## üí° THE NEW VALUE PROPOSITION

### What You're Positioned As Now:

**"Australia's Only Verified Bariatric Surgeon Directory + Concierge Service"**

**What that means:**
- Every surgeon AHPRA-verified monthly (you do it)
- Credentials confirmed: FRACS, OSSANZ, volume, hospitals (you do it)
- Gap ranges researched directly with practices (you do it)
- User clicks "Request Call" (one button)
- You call them within 24 hours (you do it)
- You verify insurance, match surgeon, coordinate (you do it)
- User just browses and answers phone (easy)

**Tagline:** "We Did The Research. You Make The Choice."

---

## üìà EXPECTED IMPACT

### Old Conversion Funnel:
- User gets estimate ‚Üí Reads DIY instructions ‚Üí Feels overwhelmed ‚Üí **Drops off**
- **Conversion rate:** Low (5-10% maybe)

### New Conversion Funnel:
- User gets estimate ‚Üí Sees pre-verified profiles ‚Üí Browses easily ‚Üí Clicks "Request Call" ‚Üí Receives call within 24hrs ‚Üí Gets exact pricing + coordination ‚Üí **Books consultation**
- **Expected conversion rate:** 2-3x higher (10-30%)

### If You Send 1000 Emails:
- **Old approach:** 50-100 consultation requests, maybe 20-30 book
- **New approach:** 100-300 consultation requests, maybe 60-120 book

**Potential impact:** 2-3x more leads per email campaign

## üìä PROJECTED SCENARIO

**If you send 1000 emails with new positioning:**

- **Day 2 (Email 2A):** 300 open, 45 click to profiles, 5-10 request calls
- **Day 10 (Email 5A):** 280 open, 40 click, 5-10 request calls
- **Day 14 (Email 6A):** 260 open, 50 click, 10-20 request calls ‚Üê Peak
- **Day 21 (Email 7A):** 240 open, 35 click, 5-10 request calls

**Total: 25-50 consultation requests per 1000 emails**

**Your job:**
- Make 25-50 calls (10 minutes each = 4-8 hours)
- Convert 50-70% to wanting to proceed (12-35 people)
- Coordinate 12-35 practice handoffs
- Track 12-35 conversions through to booking

**If 50% book consultations = 6-18 consultations booked**
**If you get $300 per consultation = $1,800-$5,400 revenue per 1000 emails**

**Worth it? You decide.**
