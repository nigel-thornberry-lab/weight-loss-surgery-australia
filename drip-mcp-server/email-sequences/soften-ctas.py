All the surgeons we list are qualified - but which one is right for YOU?

Some things to consider:
- Gap amount vs your budget
- Location convenience
- Communication style preference
- Hospital preferences
- Health fund participation

**If you'd like to talk through your options with someone who knows these surgeons:**

[Chat with us about surgeons in {{location}} ‚Üí]

We'll give you a call to discuss which ones might be the best fit for your situation. No obligation - just helpful guidance.

**Or browse and decide on your own** - that works too. You don't need us to make a good choice.

You've spent 3 weeks researching. You have:
- ‚úÖ Understanding of costs
- ‚úÖ Knowledge of payment options
- ‚úÖ Verified surgeon profiles to review
- ‚úÖ Information about the process

**Two paths from here:**

**Path 1: Keep Researching**

Maybe you're not quite ready. That's completely fine.
- Save this email for later
- Come back when the timing is right
- We'll still be here

**Path 2: Take a Next Step**

If you're leaning toward doing this, common next steps are:
- Chat with us about surgeon selection
- Book a consultation with a surgeon directly
- Discuss timeline and planning with someone who knows the process

[I'd like to discuss my options ‚Üí]

**Or don't.** This is a big decision. Only move forward when you're genuinely ready.

### One More Thing

**From the research on long-term satisfaction:**
- 82.4% satisfied 5 years after surgery¬π
- 65% say they would do it again¬π

Most patients don't regret having surgery.

They regret waiting longer than they needed to because of fear or uncertainty.

**But "when you're ready" is different for everyone.**

Some people research for months. Others know quickly. Both are fine.

We're here when you need us. No pressure.
