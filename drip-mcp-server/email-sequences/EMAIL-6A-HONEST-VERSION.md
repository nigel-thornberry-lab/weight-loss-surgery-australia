# Email 6A: Free Cost Consultation (HONEST VERSION)

**Day 14 | Subject:** Get Your Exact Gap + Payment Approval (Free, 15 Min)
**Preheader:** Stop guessing. Get real numbers from a practice coordinator.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

Two weeks ago, you saw an estimated gap: ${{estimated_cost}}.

But that was an estimate based on averages.

Your ACTUAL gap depends on:
- Your specific insurance coverage
- Which surgeon you choose
- Which hospital they use
- Your medical history
- Payment plans you qualify for

**Want to know your exact numbers?**

## Why This Matters

Your ${{estimated_cost}} estimate could be different from reality:

**Might be HIGHER than actual:**
- Your fund covers more than standard rebate
- Surgeon has lower gap than average
- You qualify for gap cover program
- Pre-op costs included in estimate but covered separately

**Might be LOWER than actual:**
- Estimate didn't include pre-op testing ($500-1,000)
- Your excess is higher than assumed
- Additional procedures needed (hernia repair, etc.)
- Surgeon's gap higher than average

Online estimates are just that - estimates based on averages. Your actual cost depends on your specific situation.

**You need the REAL number, not a guess.**

## Why People Avoid This Call (And Why That's a Mistake)

**Common excuses we hear:**

**"I'm not ready to commit yet"**
→ You're not committing. You're gathering information.

**"I don't want to be pressured"**
→ Legitimate practices don't pressure. If they do, walk away.

**"I'm embarrassed about my finances"**
→ Coordinators deal with this all day. No judgment.

**"What if I can't afford what they tell me?"**
→ Better to know now than keep wondering.

**"I'm scared of the answer"**

**The reality:** Most people who finally make this call say, "I should have done this weeks ago."
