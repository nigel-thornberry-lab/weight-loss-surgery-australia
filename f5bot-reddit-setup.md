## ‚úÖ When You Get an Alert - Do This:

### Response Framework:

**1. Read the Full Thread First**
- Understand the context
- See what others have already said
- Make sure it's genuinely asking for help

**2. If It's Relevant, Respond Helpfully**

**‚ùå BAD Response (will get downvoted/banned):**
```
"Check out BariatricSurgeryHub.com for all your weight loss surgery needs!"
```

**‚úÖ GOOD Response:**
```
I went through the gastric sleeve research process last year. Here's what I learned:

[Genuinely helpful information based on your content knowledge]

Cost-wise in Australia you're looking at $15k-25k self-funded, or $6k-12k with
private health insurance. Medicare rebates are about $1,500-2,000.

The most important thing is choosing an AHPRA-registered surgeon who does 100+
procedures a year. I used BariatricSurgeryHub's surgeon checklist to help evaluate
- really helped me know what questions to ask.

Happy to answer any specific questions if helpful.
```

**3. Timing Matters**
- Respond within 1-2 hours of alert (if possible)
- Earlier comments get more visibility
- Be the first helpful response

**4. Don't Over-Promote**
- Mention BariatricSurgeryHub ONCE per response
- Make it natural and contextual
- Focus on being helpful first

## üí° Advanced Tips

### Create a Reddit Account Specifically for This
- Username: Something professional but not obviously branded
- Example: "AusHealthResearcher" or "BariatricJourney_AU"
- Build karma by being helpful in multiple health subreddits

### Response Templates (Customize These)

**Template 1: Cost Question**
```
From my research, gastric sleeve in Australia typically costs:
- Self-funded: $15k-25k total
- With insurance: $6k-12k out of pocket
- Medicare rebate: ~$1,500-2,000

The big variable is surgeon fees + hospital choice. I found [your tool name]
helpful for calculating the true cost including hidden expenses like vitamins,
follow-ups, etc.

[Add any other genuinely helpful info]
```

**Template 2: Procedure Comparison**
```
I researched this extensively. Here's what I found:

Gastric Sleeve:
- 60-70% excess weight loss
- Removes 80% of stomach
- Not reversible
- Simpler surgery, faster recovery

Gastric Bypass:
- 70-80% excess weight loss
- Reroutes digestive system
- Better for diabetes
- More complex, longer recovery

Really depends on your BMI, health conditions, and goals. [Natural mention of
your comparison tool if relevant]
```

**Template 3: Surgeon Selection**
```
This is the most important decision. Here's what I looked for:

Must-haves:
- AHPRA registered
- Fellowship in bariatric surgery (FRACS)
- 100+ procedures per year
- Complication rate under 2%
- Hospital affiliations at accredited facilities

Red flags:
- Won't discuss complications openly
- Pressures you to decide quickly
- Unclear pricing
- No follow-up program

[Can naturally mention your surgeon checklist resource]
```
