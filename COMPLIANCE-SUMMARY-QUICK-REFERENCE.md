## 🚦 TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM

### 🟢 GREEN = FULLY COMPLIANT (Proceed)
- Interactive tools (calculators, quizzes, comparison tools)
- Educational blog (evidence-based, cited content)
- Personal tracking (private user dashboards)
- Aggregate statistics (from research, not testimonials)
- Pre-surgery/recovery programs (medical guidance)
- Recipe/exercise libraries (professional content)
- Links to external resources
- Professional Q&A (verified medical experts)

### 🟡 YELLOW = CAUTION REQUIRED (Review First)
- Educational content with examples (use hypothetical, not real patients)
- Recovery timelines (general guidance, not patient stories)
- Achievement badges (keep non-clinical and private)
- Email newsletters (no testimonials)
- Social media sharing (users can share independently, don't encourage clinical sharing)

### 🔴 RED = HIGH RISK (Modify or Avoid)
- Before/after photos with testimonials → Use aggregate data instead
- Patient success stories → Use research outcomes instead
- Video testimonials → Use surgeon education videos instead
- Community forums on-site → Use external platforms instead
- Patient Q&A → Use professional Q&A or external platform
- Mentorship programs → Refer to external resources
- Public progress sharing → Keep tracking private
