## Email Body

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out. That took courage, and we want you to know: **you're not alone in this**.

Right now, thousands of Australians are asking themselves the same questions you are:

- "Am I 'sick enough' to consider surgery?"
- "Can I actually afford this?"
- "What if I regret it?"


These questions are completely normal. In fact, studies suggest that most people consider bariatric surgery for 2-3 years before taking action. If you're feeling overwhelmed, that's okay. You're exactly where you need to be.

### What to expect from these emails

Over the next three weeks, we'll send you a series of emails designed to answer your most pressing questions—honestly and openly.

Here's what's coming:

**Week 1:**
- The real timeline from decision to recovery
- What weight loss surgery actually costs (and how people pay for it)

**Week 2:**
- Mental preparation and emotional readiness
- How to choose a surgeon (red flags included)

**Week 3:**
- Your most common questions answered
- A simple framework to decide if you're ready for a consultation

Each email is short (about 3-5 minutes to read), and you can unsubscribe anytime—no hard feelings.

### Start here if you're feeling anxious

Many people tell us they're scared to even explore this option. If that's you, we've put together a guide that addresses the most common fears people have:

**[Read: Common Fears About Weight Loss Surgery →](/common-fears)**

Or, if you're wondering whether you're mentally and emotionally ready for this step:

**[Take the Readiness Assessment →](/am-i-ready)**

### A quick promise

We're here to provide balanced, evidence-based information—not to pressure you into anything. This is your decision, and we respect whatever timeline feels right for you.
