## Time Estimate

**Per page:** ~35 minutes (research + content + insertion)

**8 remaining pages:** ~4.5 hours of focused work

---

## Options:

### A) Continue Full Enhancement (Recommended for "high bar" quality)
- Complete all 8 remaining pages systematically
- Result: 10 Liverpool-quality suburb pages
- ETA: ~4.5 more hours
- Pros: Consistent high quality across all pages, no B-grade content
- Cons: Time investment

### B) Deploy Bondi & Manly Now, Continue After User Review
- Push/deploy the 2 completed pages
- User reviews live quality
- Continue with remaining 8 if approved
- Pros: User can verify quality standard
- Cons: Deployment interruption

### C) Parallel Approach - Template + Batch Insert
- Create reusable section templates
- Batch-generate content for multiple suburbs
- Faster but potentially less customized
- Pros: Faster completion
- Cons: Slightly less suburb-specific content

---

## Recommendation:

Given your requirement: **"We must have a high bar for quality and cannot afford for any suburb pages to be less than extremely high quality"**

→ **Option A: Continue full systematic enhancement**

Bondi and Manly prove the quality standard is achievable. The remaining 8 pages will match this standard with suburb-specific content, comprehensive sections, and proper local data.

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with full enhancement of all 8 remaining pages? (my recommendation)
2. Deploy Bondi/Manly first for review?
3. Use a different approach?
