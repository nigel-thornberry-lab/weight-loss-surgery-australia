# ✅ BATCH 2 SUBURB PAGES - FIXED & DEPLOYED

**Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All 5 Pages Now Have Real Local Support Services

---

## 🎯 ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** Batch 2 suburb pages (Castle Hill, Chatswood, Hurstville, Auburn, Fairfield) had **generic placeholder text** instead of real local business information for dietitians and exercise physiologists.

**User Feedback:**
> "I notice these pages aren't linking to real local Specialist Dietitians, Exercise & Physiotherapy, or Psychological Support. Why not?"

**Root Cause:** These pages were built with generic guidance text instead of researched local businesses like the Parramatta template.
