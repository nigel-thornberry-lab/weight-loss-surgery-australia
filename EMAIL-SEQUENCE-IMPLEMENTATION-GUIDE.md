## EMAIL SEQUENCE OVERVIEW

| 2 | Day 4 | "Re: Dr. [Name] - I built something for you" | Show cost of inaction | Mathematical loss aversion |
| 3 | Day 7 | "I'm removing your profile tomorrow" | Takeaway close | Emotional investment reveal |
| 4 | Day 10 | [No subject] | Finality + loss | Past tense, profile removed |

## PERSONALIZATION CHECKLIST

### For Each Email, Replace:
- `[Name]` → Dr. John Smith
- `[Hospital]` → North Shore Private Hospital
- `[City]` → Sydney
- `[Competitor Name]` → Dr. Jane Doe (actual competitor)
- `[Competitor 1/2/3]` → 3 different competitors
- `[Specific Number]` → 127 (actual search volume)
- `[Day]` → Monday, October 21
- `[DATE]` → November 4, 2025
- `[Early Adopter]` → Dr. Michael Chen (real testimonial)
- `[Next Surgeon]` → Dr. Sarah Williams (next on list)

### Dynamic Content Blocks
**Search Results Gap (Email 1):**
```
And when they searched, here's what they found:
→ Your practice website (page 2)
→ Healthshare listing (outdated info)
→ RateMDs (3 reviews from 2019)
→ Random forum posts asking "Is Dr. [Name] any good?"
```
*Customize based on actual search results for each surgeon*

**Loss Calculation (Email 2):**
```
If 890 people search "bariatric surgeon Sydney" monthly:
→ Page 1 surgeons get ~600 clicks
→ Page 2 surgeons get ~60 clicks
```
*Use actual search volume for their city*

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

"No catch. We make money from advertising and partnerships, not from surgeons. Your verified profile makes our directory more valuable. Win-win."

### "I don't have time for this"
**Response:**
"That's exactly why we built it this way. You invest 5 minutes once. We handle everything else - writing, updates, maintenance, compliance."

### "How do I know this is legitimate?"
**Response:**
"Great question. We're AHPRA-compliant, use transparent verification methodology, and we're already working with 50+ surgeons including Dr. [Name] at [Hospital]. Happy to provide references."

### "I'm concerned about AHPRA compliance"
**Response:**
"We've done the legal work. Our profiles display only factual information - credentials, experience, affiliations. No testimonials, no 'best' claims. Just verification."

### "Why are you doing this for free?"
**Response:**
"We're building long-term value. A comprehensive, trusted directory benefits everyone. We're playing the long game."
