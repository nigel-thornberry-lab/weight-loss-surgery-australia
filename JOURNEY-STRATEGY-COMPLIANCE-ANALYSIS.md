# Journey Partner Strategy: AHPRA Compliance Analysis

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure all proposed journey features comply with AHPRA Section 133 and Australian healthcare advertising laws

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **GOOD NEWS:** Most journey partner features (70-80%) are **fully compliant**  
⚠️ **CAUTION:** Some features require **modification** to comply  
❌ **HIGH RISK:** A few features are **prohibited as proposed** and need complete redesign

**Overall Assessment:** The journey partner strategy is **achievable and compliant** with modifications to high-risk features.

---

## AHPRA Compliance Framework (Quick Reference)

### ❌ PROHIBITED (Section 133)
- Individual patient testimonials with clinical content
- Before/after photos with outcome claims or endorsements
- Patient success stories that promote clinical outcomes
- Video testimonials about procedures or results
- Patient endorsements of surgeon's clinical skills
- Community posts that constitute promotional testimonials

### ✅ ALLOWED
- Aggregate data (ratings, statistics)
- Factual information (procedures offered, qualifications)
- Educational content (non-promotional)
- Interactive tools (calculators, trackers)
- Recovery information (general medical guidance)
- Community support (if properly moderated)

### 🔑 KEY PRINCIPLE
> "If it's on your website promoting health services AND contains patient opinions about clinical matters → PROHIBITED"

---

## PHASE-BY-PHASE COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

---

## PHASE 1: Foundation Features (Months 1-3)

### ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT - No Issues

#### 1. Interactive Tools
**Proposed Features:**
- BMI Calculator
- Eligibility Quiz
- Cost Estimator
- Weight Loss Projector
- Procedure Comparison Tool
- Surgeon Comparison Tool

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **100% COMPLIANT**

**Rationale:**
- These are educational tools providing factual information
- No patient testimonials or endorsements
- Calculators = objective data processing
- Comparison tools = factual data presentation
- AHPRA explicitly allows educational content

**Implementation:** Proceed as planned, no modifications needed.

---

#### 2. Educational Blog Content
**Proposed Features:**
- 2-4 articles per week
- Topics: BMI understanding, health conditions, surgery vs. diet, preparation guides
- Video explainers (embedded)
- Downloadable guides (PDFs)

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT WITH CAUTIONS**

**✅ Allowed Content:**
- General medical education ("What is BMI?")
- Procedure explanations (factual, not promotional)
- Recovery timelines (general medical information)
- Nutrition guidelines (general dietary advice)
- Exercise recommendations (general fitness advice)

**⚠️ Must Avoid:**
- Patient testimonials embedded in articles
- "Patient story" format that promotes outcomes
- Claims about success rates or guarantees
- Comparative statements ("best," "leading," "most successful")
- Before/after case studies presented promotionally

**Recommended Approach:**
- Focus on evidence-based medical information
- Cite published research, not patient experiences
- Use hypothetical examples, not real patient stories
- Include standard medical disclaimers
- Have healthcare professional review content

**Example (Compliant):**
```
❌ BAD: "Sarah lost 35kg in 6 months with gastric sleeve surgery from Dr. Smith"
✅ GOOD: "Clinical studies show patients typically lose 60-70% of excess weight within 12-18 months following gastric sleeve surgery"
```

---

#### 3. Pre-Consultation Resources
**Proposed Features:**
- Pre-consultation checklist
- What to bring to appointment
- Questions to ask surgeon
- Medical history preparation

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **100% COMPLIANT**

**Rationale:**
- Factual preparation information
- No promotional testimonials
- Educational support for patients

**Implementation:** Proceed as planned.

---

#### 4. Insurance & Funding Guide
**Proposed Features:**
- Medicare eligibility criteria
- Private health insurance waiting periods
- Payment plan providers
- Superannuation access guide

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **100% COMPLIANT**

**Rationale:**
- Factual financial information
- No clinical claims or testimonials
- Consumer guidance

**Implementation:** Proceed as planned.

---

## PHASE 2: Transformation Gallery (Months 4-6)

### ⚠️ HIGH RISK AREA - REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION

#### 1. Before/After Photo Galleries
**Proposed Feature:** Patient photo galleries with weight loss transformations, filterable by procedure, BMI, timeframe.

**Compliance Status:** ❌ **PROHIBITED AS PROPOSED** → ⚠️ **CAN BE MODIFIED TO COMPLY**

**Why It's Prohibited (As Proposed):**

AHPRA compliance document explicitly states:
> "Review Carefully: Before/after photos (restricted for some procedures)"

**The Problem:**
Before/after photos **with accompanying testimonial content** constitute:
1. Visual testimonials about clinical outcomes
2. Promotional use of patient images
3. Implied endorsement of surgical skill
4. Claims about results/success

**Three Compliance Options:**

---

##### **OPTION A: No Before/After Photos** ✅ **SAFEST**
- **Compliance:** 100% compliant
- **User Impact:** Loses major conversion driver
- **Recommendation:** Only if unable to implement Option B or C

---

##### **OPTION B: Aggregate Visual Data Only** ✅ **COMPLIANT & EFFECTIVE**

**What You CAN Do:**
- Display **aggregate weight loss statistics** without individual photos
- Show **charts and graphs** of typical outcomes
- Use **illustrations or diagrams** (not real patient photos)
- Reference **published clinical studies** with outcome data

**Example Implementation:**
```

│                                                  │
│   Data sourced from published medical research  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Compliance Rationale:**
- No individual patient images
- Aggregate data from research (not testimonials)
- Educational, not promotional
- No patient endorsements

**User Impact:** 
- ✅ Still shows compelling data
- ✅ Evidence-based and trustworthy
- ❌ Less emotionally impactful than photos
- ⚠️ Reduces viral sharing potential

---

##### **OPTION C: Third-Party Platform with Disclaimer** ⚠️ **RISKY BUT POSSIBLE**

**What You MIGHT Be Able To Do:**
- Link to surgeon's **own** website galleries (not hosted by you)
- Link to **peer-reviewed journal articles** with clinical photos
- Link to **OSSANZ or medical society** resources with outcome photos
- Embed **YouTube videos** from surgeons' own channels (with disclaimers)

**Critical Requirements:**
1. Photos must **NOT be hosted on your website**
2. Must have **clear disclaimer** that you don't control content
3. Must be **clearly labeled** as external link
4. Cannot **selectively curate** which surgeon galleries to link to
5. Must link to **all surgeons equally** (no preferential treatment)

**Example Implementation:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   View Surgical Outcomes                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                  │
│   ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER                       │
│   The following links direct to external        │
│   websites operated by individual surgeons.     │
│   Weight Loss Surgery Australia does not        │
│   host, control, or endorse the content on      │
│   these external sites.                         │
│                                                  │
│   [View Dr. Smith's Gallery] ↗ External         │
│   (Hosted on drsmith.com.au)                    │
│                                                  │
│   [View Dr. Jones's Gallery] ↗ External         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Compliance Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Gray area - AHPRA could still argue you're promoting via links
- ⚠️ Similar to Google reviews issue (you have control over displaying links)
- ⚠️ May not protect you from liability
- ⚠️ Requires legal review

**Recommendation:** 
- Consult healthcare advertising lawyer before implementing
- Option B (aggregate data) is safer
- If pursuing, get written legal advice

---

##### **OPTION D: Anonymous Clinical Photography (Non-Promotional)** ⚠️ **VERY RISKY**

**What You MIGHT Be Able To Do:**
- Use **completely anonymized** photos (no face, identifying features)
- Present as **educational clinical documentation** (not promotional)
- Must be **no endorsement or testimonial content**
- Must be **representative of typical outcomes** (not cherry-picked)
- Must include **risks and complications prominently**

**Critical Requirements:**
1. Photos must be **completely anonymous** (full face blur, no tattoos, etc.)
2. **No patient quotes or testimonials** with photos
3. **No filtering by surgeon** (not "Dr. Smith's results")
4. Must show **range of outcomes** (including less successful cases)
5. Must have **prominent disclaimer** about variability of results
6. Must display **risks and potential complications** equally prominently

**Example Implementation:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Clinical Outcomes Documentation               │
│   Educational Resource Only                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                  │

│   • Weight Lost: 45kg                           │
│   • Complications: None reported                │

│                                                  │
│   RISKS & COMPLICATIONS:                        │
│   • Bleeding (2-4% of patients)                 │
│   • Infection (1-3% of patients)                │
│   • Leaks (1-2% of patients)                    │
│   • Nutritional deficiencies (5-10%)            │
│   • Weight regain (varies)                      │
│                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Compliance Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Still risky - AHPRA may view as promotional
- ⚠️ Even anonymous photos can imply endorsement
- ⚠️ Showing only successful cases = misleading
- ⚠️ Requires showing complications equally = less compelling

**Recommendation:** 
- **VERY HIGH RISK** - likely to attract AHPRA scrutiny
- Option B (aggregate data) is much safer
- Only pursue with explicit legal clearance
- Not recommended without lawyer sign-off

---

##### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR BEFORE/AFTER GALLERIES:**

✅ **RECOMMENDED: Option B (Aggregate Visual Data)**
- Fully compliant
- Still compelling for users
- Evidence-based and trustworthy
- No legal risk

⚠️ **POSSIBLE: Option C (Third-Party Links)**
- Requires legal review
- Medium risk
- Good user experience if approved

❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: Options A (No Photos) or D (Risky Anonymous Photos)**
- Option A loses too much value
- Option D has too much legal risk

---

#### 2. Patient Success Stories (Written/Video)
**Proposed Feature:** Written testimonials, video testimonials, "My Journey" timelines, statistics dashboards per patient.

**Compliance Status:** ❌ **PROHIBITED AS PROPOSED**

**Why It's Prohibited:**
- Written patient testimonials about clinical outcomes = Section 133 violation
- Video testimonials = even worse (more impactful promotional use)
- "My Journey" timeline = testimonial in story format
- Individual patient statistics = promotional claim

**The Rule:**
From AHPRA compliance doc:
> "What's Prohibited: Patient testimonials (clinical), Before/after stories (outcomes), Patient endorsements"

**Three Compliance Options:**

---

##### **OPTION A: No Patient Stories** ✅ **SAFEST**
- Simply don't include this feature
- Focus on aggregate data and clinical studies

---

##### **OPTION B: Aggregate Success Metrics** ✅ **COMPLIANT & EFFECTIVE**

**What You CAN Do:**
- Show **aggregate statistics** from published research
- Display **typical outcome ranges** based on clinical studies
- Reference **medical literature** about success rates
- Show **population-level data** (not individual stories)

**Example Implementation:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Long-Term Outcome Data                        │
│   Based on 10-Year Clinical Studies             │

│                                                  │
│   Weight Loss Success Rates:                    │
│   • 60-70% maintain significant weight loss     │
│   • Average weight loss: 25-30kg at 5 years     │
│                                                  │
│   Health Improvements Reported:                 │
│   • Type 2 Diabetes: 60-80% remission rate      │
│   • Hypertension: 70% improvement rate          │
│   • Sleep Apnea: 75% resolution rate            │
│                                                  │
│   Quality of Life Improvements:                 │
│   • Mobility: 85% report improvement            │
│   • Mental Health: 70% report improvement       │
│   • Social Life: 65% report improvement         │
│                                                  │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Compliance Rationale:**
- No individual patient stories
- Aggregate data from credible medical sources
- Educational, not promotional
- No patient endorsements

---

##### **OPTION C: Third-Party Testimonials (External Links)** ⚠️ **RISKY**

**What You MIGHT Be Able To Do:**
- Link to **RealSelf** profiles where patients share stories
- Link to surgeon's **own website** testimonials (not hosted by you)
- Link to **Facebook support groups** where patients share experiences
- Embed **YouTube videos** from patients' own channels (with disclaimers)

**Critical Requirements:**
1. Content must **NOT be hosted on your website**
2. Must have **prominent disclaimer** you don't control content
3. Cannot **selectively curate** which stories to link to
4. Must be **clearly labeled** as external link
5. Cannot **benefit financially** from testimonial clicks

**Compliance Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Same issue as Google reviews - you have control over what you link to
- ⚠️ AHPRA may view linking as "using" testimonials
- ⚠️ Gray area that requires legal review

**Recommendation:** Not recommended without legal sign-off.

---

##### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR SUCCESS STORIES:**

✅ **RECOMMENDED: Option B (Aggregate Success Metrics)**
- Fully compliant
- Still compelling for users
- Evidence-based
- No legal risk

❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: Patient testimonials in any form hosted on your site**
- Clear Section 133 violation
- High enforcement risk

---

## PHASE 3: Journey Tracking (Months 7-9)

### ✅ MOSTLY COMPLIANT - Some Cautions

#### 1. Personal Dashboard & User Accounts
**Proposed Features:**
- User registration
- Personal profile (surgery date, procedure, starting weight)
- Saved surgeons & comparisons
- Appointment history

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **100% COMPLIANT**

**Rationale:**
- Personal data tools (not testimonials)
- Individual use (not promotional)
- No display of patient experiences to public

**Implementation:** Proceed as planned.

---

#### 2. Pre-Surgery 8-Week Program
**Proposed Features:**
- Week-by-week preparation content
- Checklists
- Nutrition plans
- Exercise recommendations
- Progress tracking

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT WITH CAUTIONS**

**✅ Allowed:**
- General medical guidance on preparation
- Evidence-based nutrition plans
- Exercise recommendations
- Checklists and organizational tools

**⚠️ Must Avoid:**
- Patient testimonials in content ("Sarah says...")
- Before/after transformations during prep phase
- Promotional claims about outcomes
- Implied guarantees of success

**Recommended Approach:**
- Base all content on published medical guidelines
- Cite credible sources (OSSANZ, medical journals)
- Use hypothetical examples, not real patient stories
- Include standard medical disclaimers
- Have healthcare professional review content

**Implementation:** Proceed with medical content review.

---

#### 3. Recovery 12-Week Program
**Proposed Features:**
- Week-by-week recovery milestones
- Nutrition progression (liquid → solid)
- Exercise progression
- Weight/photo/symptom trackers
- Recipe library
- Exercise video library

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT WITH CAUTIONS**

**✅ Allowed:**
- General post-operative medical guidance
- Evidence-based recovery protocols
- Nutrition progression guidelines
- Exercise recommendations
- Personal tracking tools (private to user)

**⚠️ Must Avoid:**
- Sharing patient tracking data publicly (becomes testimonial)
- "Success story" features based on user data
- Leaderboards or comparisons between users (promotes competition/outcomes)
- Public before/after photo galleries from users
- User testimonials displayed to others

**Critical Implementation Rules:**

1. **Keep User Data Private**
   - Users can track their own progress
   - Cannot share/display tracking data to other users without becoming testimonial
   - No "featured user of the month" type features

2. **Recipe/Exercise Content Must Be:**
   - Evidence-based medical guidance
   - Sourced from credible sources (dietitians, medical literature)
   - General recommendations, not personalized medical advice
   - Include disclaimers to consult healthcare provider

3. **Community Features (if included):**
   - See Phase 4 analysis for community compliance rules

**Recommended Disclaimer:**
```
IMPORTANT: This recovery program provides general medical 
information only. It does not constitute personalized medical 
advice. Always follow your surgeon's specific instructions 
and consult your healthcare team for personalized guidance.
Individual results and recovery experiences vary significantly.
```

**Implementation:** Proceed with medical content review and proper disclaimers.

---

## PHASE 4: Community & Support (Months 10-12)

### ⚠️ HIGHEST RISK AREA - REQUIRES HEAVY MODERATION

#### 1. Community Forums
**Proposed Feature:** Forums for pre-op, post-op, procedure-specific discussions, location groups, success story sharing.

**Compliance Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONALLY COMPLIANT** (Heavy moderation required)

**The Major Risk:**
User-generated content in forums **will inevitably contain testimonials** about clinical outcomes. When these appear on YOUR website, YOU are responsible for compliance.

From AHPRA compliance doc:
> "The clinic business owner or practitioner (that is, whoever has control over the website) is responsible for compliance."

**Two Compliance Options:**

---

##### **OPTION A: No Community Features** ✅ **SAFEST**
- Avoid the problem entirely
- Recommend external communities (Facebook groups, RealSelf forums)
- Link to existing support resources

---

##### **OPTION B: Heavily Moderated Community** ⚠️ **RISKY BUT POSSIBLE**

**What You CAN Do:**
- General support forums (non-clinical discussions)
- Emotional support and mental health discussions
- Practical life questions (travel, work, relationships)
- Non-promotional sharing

**What You MUST PREVENT:**
- Testimonials about surgical outcomes
- Endorsements of specific surgeons
- Before/after photos or transformations
- Clinical success stories
- Promotional content

**Required Implementation:**

1. **Pre-Moderation (Safest but Burdensome):**
   - All posts reviewed BEFORE publishing
   - Moderator approves/rejects each post
   - Slow user experience but highest compliance

2. **Post-Moderation (Faster but Riskier):**
   - Posts go live immediately
   - Moderator reviews within 24 hours
   - Remove non-compliant content quickly
   - Risk: non-compliant content visible temporarily

3. **Automated Filtering:**
   - Keyword filtering for clinical terms
   - Auto-flag posts mentioning outcomes, transformations, surgeon names
   - Human review of flagged content
   - Not foolproof but helps

4. **Clear Community Guidelines:**
```
COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

Welcome! This is a support space for emotional and 
practical discussions about the bariatric surgery journey.

✅ You CAN share:
- Your feelings and emotional experiences
- Practical life questions (work, travel, relationships)
- Non-clinical challenges and solutions
- General encouragement and support

❌ You CANNOT share:
- Specific details about surgical outcomes or results
- Before/after photos or weight loss numbers
- Endorsements of specific surgeons or clinics
- Medical advice or clinical recommendations
- Success stories that promote clinical outcomes

WHY? Australian healthcare advertising regulations (AHPRA 
Section 133) prohibit testimonials about clinical matters 
on websites promoting health services. To keep this 
community available for everyone, we must moderate 
content accordingly.

Violating posts will be removed. Repeat violations may 
result in account suspension. Thank you for understanding!
```

5. **Dedicated Moderator:**
   - Budget: $500-1,000/month minimum
   - 2-4 hours daily monitoring
   - Medical/legal knowledge helpful
   - Clear escalation process for borderline content

6. **Regular Legal Review:**
   - Quarterly compliance audits
   - Sample post reviews by lawyer
   - Update guidelines as needed

**The Hard Reality:**
Even with perfect moderation, AHPRA could argue:
- "You created a space for testimonials to be shared"
- "You benefit from user engagement (even if you moderate)"
- "You should have predicted clinical testimonials would occur"

**Liability Warning:**
You are legally responsible for **every post** that appears on your website, even temporarily. One non-compliant post that's live for even a few hours could trigger an AHPRA investigation.

---

##### **OPTION C: External Community Platform** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**What You CAN Do:**
- Create a **Facebook Group** (hosted by Facebook, not you)
- Create a **Discord Server** (hosted by Discord, not you)
- Partner with existing **RealSelf community**
- Link to existing **OSSANZ patient resources**

**Compliance Rationale:**
- Community is NOT on your website
- You don't have "control" in AHPRA's definition
- Testimonials on Facebook are Facebook's responsibility, not yours
- You're just facilitating connection, not hosting content

**Example Implementation:**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No AHPRA compliance risk for testimonials
- ✅ Facebook handles moderation burden
- ✅ Users still get community support
- ✅ Easier to manage and scale
- ✅ No liability for user-generated content

**Drawbacks:**
- ❌ Less control over community experience
- ❌ Users may share your site less (community off-platform)
- ❌ Can't track community engagement metrics
- ❌ Facebook could change policies or shut down group

---

##### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR COMMUNITY:**

✅ **RECOMMENDED: Option C (External Community Platform)**
- No AHPRA risk
- Still provides user value
- Much easier to manage
- No moderation burden

⚠️ **POSSIBLE: Option B (Heavily Moderated On-Site)**
- Requires substantial ongoing investment ($1,000+/month)
- Significant legal risk despite moderation
- Requires dedicated staff and legal review
- Only pursue if you have resources and accept risk

❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: Unmoderated or lightly-moderated on-site forums**
- Clear AHPRA violation waiting to happen
- Will attract testimonials immediately
- You'll be liable for every non-compliant post

---

#### 2. Q&A Platform
**Proposed Feature:** "Ask the Community" with searchable Q&A database, voting, expert answers.

**Compliance Status:** ⚠️ **RISKY** - Same issues as forums

**The Problem:**
- User questions/answers will contain clinical testimonials
- "How was your recovery with Dr. Smith?" = testimonial
- "I lost 40kg, here's what worked for me" = testimonial
- Even questions like "Did the surgery help your diabetes?" prompt testimonials

**Compliance Options:**

##### **OPTION A: No Q&A Platform** ✅ **SAFEST**

##### **OPTION B: Medical Professional Q&A Only** ✅ **COMPLIANT**

**What You CAN Do:**
- Surgeons, dietitians, psychologists answer questions
- Professional medical advice (general, not personalized)
- No patient-to-patient answers
- Heavily moderated questions

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Ask Our Medical Experts                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                  │
│   Q: "What should I expect in the first week    │
│      after gastric sleeve surgery?"             │
│                                                  │
│   A: [Dr. Smith, Bariatric Surgeon]             │
│      "In the first week post-surgery, most      │
│      patients experience..."                    │
│      [Evidence-based medical information]       │
│                                                  │
│   ⚠️ This is general information only. Always   │
│   consult your surgeon for personalized advice. │
│                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Requirements:**
- Only verified medical professionals can answer
- Questions moderated before posting
- Remove any that request/contain testimonials
- Answers must be general medical education, not personalized advice
- Prominent disclaimers

##### **OPTION C: Link to External Q&A** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

Link to:
- RealSelf Q&A platform
- OSSANZ patient resources
- Facebook group Q&A
- Reddit r/wls community

**Benefit:** No compliance risk, users still get answers.

---

##### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR Q&A:**

✅ **RECOMMENDED: Option B (Professional Q&A) OR Option C (External Platform)**
- Both compliant
- Provide user value
- Manageable risk

❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: Community Q&A with patient answers**
- Will attract testimonials
- High AHPRA risk

---

#### 3. Patient Mentorship Program
**Proposed Feature:** Match pre-op with post-op mentors, "surgery buddy" system, private messaging.

**Compliance Status:** ⚠️ **VERY RISKY** - Essentially facilitating testimonials

**The Problem:**
- Mentors sharing their experiences = testimonials
- Even in private messages, if facilitated by your website, you may be liable
- Mentors will inevitably discuss outcomes, surgeon quality, recovery experiences

**From AHPRA perspective:**
Your website is creating a system specifically for patients to share clinical experiences with the purpose of influencing others' healthcare decisions. This is the **definition** of promotional testimonials.

**Compliance Options:**

##### **OPTION A: No Mentorship Program** ✅ **SAFEST**

##### **OPTION B: Professional Mentorship Only** ⚠️ **POSSIBLY COMPLIANT**

**What You MIGHT Be Able To Do:**
- Connect patients with **healthcare professionals** (nurses, dietitians)
- Professional guidance only (not peer testimonials)
- Paid service (not free promotional testimonials)
- Clear professional boundaries

**Requirements:**
- Only licensed healthcare professionals as mentors
- No patient-to-patient mentorship
- Professional guidance, not personal stories
- Documented guidelines prohibiting testimonials

##### **OPTION C: External Platform** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Facilitate mentorship through:**
- Facebook Group connections (off your website)
- Referrals to existing RealSelf mentorship
- Connect patients via email (offline communication)
- Recommend external support groups

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Connect with Experienced Patients              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                  │
│   Many patients find it helpful to connect      │
│   with others who have been through the         │
│   bariatric surgery journey.                    │
│                                                  │
│   We recommend joining these communities        │
│   where you can connect with mentors:           │
│                                                  │
│   • [Bariatric Support Facebook Group] ↗        │
│   • [RealSelf Community] ↗                      │
│   • [OSSANZ Patient Resources] ↗                │
│                                                  │
│   These platforms are not operated by us and    │
│   we do not control their content.              │
│                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

##### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR MENTORSHIP:**

✅ **RECOMMENDED: Option C (External Platform Referral)**
- No AHPRA risk
- Still helps users connect
- Practical and low-maintenance

❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: Patient-to-patient mentorship facilitated on your site**
- High risk of being viewed as facilitating testimonials
- Even private messages could be problematic
- Not worth the legal risk

---

## ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### 5. Social Media Integration

**Scenario:** "Share your progress on social media!"

**Compliance Status:** ⚠️ **CAUTION**

**What You CAN Do:**
- Users share independently on their own (not your responsibility) ✅
- Share educational content from your blog ✅
- Share aggregate statistics ✅

**What You SHOULD AVOID:**
- "Share your before/after transformation!" buttons ❌
- "Tell your friends about your surgery results!" prompts ❌

- Quarterly compliance audits
- High risk of AHPRA scrutiny
- Potential for enforcement actions

**Only Consider If:**
- You have substantial legal budget
