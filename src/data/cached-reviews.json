        "text": "Thank God for Dr Pulitano.  I phoned his Office Manager Sabrina, the day after I was told I had stage 4 liver metastases.  She was helpful and reassuring.  Dr Pulitano met with me and my husband very soon thereafter and he was professional, patient and compassionate.  Unfortunately, I was initially inoperable but that did not stop Dr Pulitano and Sabrina from acting as my advocates and communicating with the incredible team of doctors and nurses taking care of me at Chris O’Brien Lifehouse.  It was nearly a year later after many cycles of chemotherapy that I was deemed operable.  Dr Pulitano was there for me throughout this time.  The surgery I had was extensive and very high risk but I went into it well informed and confident that I could not have a better team than the one Dr Pulitano had at RPAH.  The surgery has gone well and my prognosis is greatly improved thanks to the talent and courage of this surgeon.  Having worked in medicine, my family and I both realise what a blessing it is to be under Dr Pulitano’s care.",

I have sometimes felt powerless, unheard and time pressured during consults with other specialists, and on occasion I've felt like I was just a money making exercise for the professional in the chair.\nDr Fisher blew me away. He is none of that. I left my appointment feeling truly cared for. He took so much time going through all my options -  what was so refreshing was that he communicated with me, not just talked at me. He listened, he was honest and gave both the pros and cons,  he was thorough with information and made sure to cover all aspects of the topic. He is kind, engaging, compassionate and I suspect an extremely talented individual. His other glowing reviews about his skills are surely not doubted by me after experiencing the quality of being he is. I think the greatest outcome of my introduction to be treated by him is that I feel...safe.  I don't think I've ever felt instantly safe in a strangers hands before. I'm confident that whether further scans reveal I need surgery or not,  I am confident that if I do go under the knife, my life is safe in his hands and I will be well looked after.

Dr Fisher talked me through the process before operating and what needed to be done. Had scans , bloods done and before I knew it Dr fisher was back to give me results and next steps I can’t speak highly enough of him as normally you don’t see your surgeon until your back in theatre. I saw Dr Fisher 3 times before surgery . Also I would like to mention his team and assistant Coreen who was very helpful at organizing me into the hospital at such short notice all that I can say Great hands to be in .\nThank you so much . Best hands to be in .",

In July of last year, I underwent a full gastric bypass performed by Michael and his surgical support team. Throughout each stage of the process, Professor Talbot and his team exhibited exceptional professionalism, expertise, and care. The surgery was highly successful, leading to significant improvements in my quality of life and health. Professor Talbot's skill and precision were evident during the entire procedure, and his compassionate approach made the experience considerably more manageable. I am profoundly grateful for the transformative impact of the surgery and highly recommend Associate Professor Michael Talbot and his entire team to anyone considering weight loss surgery.

His down to earth honesty and guidance, made my journey a much easier one. Many specialist bog you down with technical talk. Dr Talbots explanations made sense and alleviated any concerns I had. This was my first ever major procedure and going into theatre I wasn't scared, I was excited for my new life to begin.\nThanks Mike I'm so happy to be going through my journey with you.",

From the moment I walked into the clinic, I was impressed by the warm, welcoming atmosphere and the professionalism of every staff member.\nDr. Das is truly outstanding - he combines exceptional medical expertise with genuine compassion for his patients. He took the time to thoroughly explain my condition, answered all my questions with patience, and made sure I felt comfortable throughout the entire process. His attention to detail and comprehensive approach to care gave me complete confidence in his treatment plan.\nThe nursing staff and support team are equally impressive. They were attentive, efficient, and always went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. The administrative staff made scheduling appointments seamless and were always helpful with insurance questions and follow-up care coordination.\nThe facility itself is modern, clean, and well-organised. Wait times were minimal, and the entire experience was smooth from check-in to discharge. It's clear that Dr. Das has built a practice centred on patient care and excellence.\nI would recommend Dr. Das and his team without hesitation to anyone seeking quality medical care. They truly set the standard for what healthcare should be - professional, compassionate, and patient-focused.",

The consultation couldn’t proceed; instead, it was more of a brief meeting where I was advised to send the documents — documents the clinic had failed to remind me of in the first place. Yet I was still charged the full fee.\n\nWhen I followed up, the receptionist told me it was solely my responsibility to know what to bring and claimed that “95% of their clients know what to bring” without being told. She even suggested I send another email about our phone conversation so she could forward it to Dr Devadas — a remark that came across as indifferent, condescending, and designed to reinforce that she was right and I was wrong rather than acknowledging the clinic’s failure to provide clear instructions.  The lack of accountability, empathy, and professionalism was unacceptable, and I was left feeling blamed for something I could not reasonably have anticipated.\n\nTo be clear, Dr Devadas himself appeared friendly and professional during the brief first consultation. I however would not return to this clinic again — 50% because of the wasted first appointment, and 50% because of the receptionist, whose apathetic, hostile, and insensitive attitude made the experience far worse.\n\nClear communication and basic respect should not be too much to expect and no patient should be treated this way by a clinic meant to provide care.",

Dr LePage has very reasonable fees, especially considering his expertise and peer respect in his chosen field.  I feel so very grateful for the new life Dr LePage has given me.

He listens and hears what you are saying, explains everything clearly and works with you as a patient if you want to be actively involved in the process.  I feel like he didn't give up on what was a long diagnostic path including getting other specialists in for a second opinion when required.  He also made great personal effort to schedule surgery  on the weekend chasing down anaesthetists out of hours to cater for my domestic family situation at home so I could get home quicker.  If he was not available in the hospital and there were concerns then he ensured that questions were answered by phone; many time which were well out of business hours.  Thanks Ramez for your professional  and personal service.",

He is extremely knowledgeable and explained everything to me and answered my 1000 questions with the upmost patience! He thoroughly explained all of my options and together, we worked out a game plan. His team is definitely a 10/10 also! From Steph his practice manager who is so helpful, and accommodating to Penny the dietician who gave me the best advice and continues to be my almanac on everything dietry support, to Cameron his anesthetist who is the best guy I've ever had putting in a canula! Cameron immediately eased any pre op nerves. The whole team is like extended family and you immediately feel right at home.  If you are considering bariatric surgery, do yourself a favor and book in!  My only disappointment is that I did not do it years ago! Dr Hopkins is an absolute professional with a great personality and caring nature and he has the best taste in music which was awesome in the operating theater.

As someone with multiple chronic conditions/disability, I have seen countless surgeons over the years, but Stuart has to be the worst.\nI was referred to this guy to investigate lower abdo pain. He consistently cut us off and talked over the top of myself and my carer when answering his questions.\nHe confidently diagnosed me (incorrectly) with something I'd already had ruled out by countless examinations and tests. He insisted on repeating scopes I'd already had recently (no outcome) because he had not done it himself. I left extremely upset and angry as he had not listened to a single thing we'd said, however he insisted that this is just the *first step* and, though it might be hard, he \"will figure it out\". I went along with the scopes he insisted on which, as expected, yielded no answers and proved his arrogant prediction wrong.\nI then heard nothing so I contacted the office requesting his guidance on next steps (as he'd indicated this was simply the *first step*). His reply stated that since he did not find anything, he saw \"no point being involved in (my) care moving forward.\"\nIn addition, reception staff were extremely rude and dismissive of my needs as a person with a disability who could not easily prep for these tests and denied any assistance in securing a hospital bed overnight to prep for the procedure. This was discussed during our consult, however when the time came I was simply told \"well maybe you should've mentioned it during your consult.\"\nHe doesn't listen and he doesn't give a toss.",

Whilst his knowledge and expertise is second to none it’s his care, kindness and genuine empathy for his patients that really sets him apart from any other doctor I have been treated by. I had been struggling with gut issues for 2 years after contracting a stomach bug from drinking tank water and no doctor I had been seen by was able to give me any relief from the debilitating symptoms. I remember crying through my whole initial appointment with doctor Suhirdan because my illness was affecting my life so much. I was engaged at the time and wasn’t even looking forward to my wedding because I was so anxious about being sick on the day. Since that initial appointment Dr Suhirdan has helped me so much. Whilst I still have a little way to go im pleased to say i am well on the way to getting my life back. When my sickness was at its worst I came across excellent reviews about Dr Suhirdan which helped me find him. So I hope this review helps someone else like me. I am pleased to say I got married last week and thanks to Dr Suhirdan I enjoyed every second of the day!",

In the midst of this medical crisis, Dr. Nahm took charge, leading a compassionate and highly skilled medical team to handle her complex case with precision and care, ultimately guiding her to a smooth and successful recovery.\n\nWhat impressed us the most was his ability to design a less invasive yet durable solution, all within the constraints of an urgent, time-sensitive situation. Although we don’t have extensive medical knowledge, it was clear that we were under the care of an exceptional physician, whose unwavering dedication to saving lives shone through every step of the process. Dr. Nahm exemplifies the highest standard of medical excellence and is, without a doubt, highly recommended!",

After arguing with her and getting attitude, she called the doctor and decided to try and fix a couple of the spots……even though, I’m sure she gave me a highly diluted dose just to shut me up.\nI now need to save my money again and try somewhere more reputable who stand behind the guarantee to give you results!!!!\nNEVER AGAIN",

However, I feel it’s important for the public to know about the incredible care and expertise I received from Dr. Anthony Clough and the Melbourne Centre for Bariatric Surgery.\n\nBefore deciding to proceed with Dr. Clough, I consulted several doctors. What stood out about him was his honesty, openness, and genuine empathy for my situation. From the very beginning, he made me feel comfortable and informed about my options. The anaesthetist was also warm and reassuring, taking the time to explain everything and ensure I fully understood the process.\n\nI cannot thank the entire MCBS team enough for my life-saving SIPS surgery. From the very start, everything was clearly explained, and I was given the opportunity to discuss my options in full. The post-operative care I received in the hospital was outstanding. I even shared some laughs with Carol (the office manager) about Suzi Q, and Dr. Clough himself visited me several times while I was recovering, which truly showed his dedication and compassion. You can tell this is his passion.\n\nSince my weight loss journey began in January 2023, and after having surgery in June 2023, I have now lost 130kg (pictures attached, picture on left taken January 2023, picture on right taken January 2025)—and I haven’t had a single issue related to the procedure. No reflux, no indigestion—nothing. I even recommended a friend, who was just as happy with her results.\n\nThank you, Anthony, for saving my life. If I had to do it all over again, I would choose you 100% without hesitation.\n\nHighly recommend!",

From our very first meeting I knew that Richard had my best interests at heart, and the subsequent consultations I had with him served to strengthen my confidence in his surgical ability and in his commitment to holistic patient care. My situation was a challenge for Richard as, with an ejection fraction (how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction) of 22.5%, it would, under normal circumstances, not be considered safe for me to have surgery. However, I was not only asymptomatic but I was strong and healthy and positive, and definitely keen to have surgery to remove the tumour in my oesophagus. Richard championed my case for surgery calling on the advice and opinions of numerous specialists. His investigations and deliberations were extremely thorough and his tireless capacity to inform me at every stage of the process meant that I was fully aware of the risks and the potential outcomes of the surgery if I chose to proceed. The surgery took place at the Alfred where one of the nursing staff on Ward 2 East told me she watched the entire surgery and was in awe of Richard’s skill and commitment. She said it was brilliant. Richard has maintained an exemplary level of post-surgery care with multiple daily bedside visits from himself and his team members. Thank you Richard for believing in me and for all the hard work you put into making this surgery happen for me. You were prepared to look beyond my test results on paper (which I was told many times were “crap”) and consider the physical and mental toughness of the individual, thereby successfully performing a huge operation on a 70 year old man with heart failure.\nIan Farnsworth",

From the very first consultation, Dr. Niruben treated me not just as a patient, but as a person with compassion, empathy, and an incredible depth of understanding. He listened to all my fears, answered every question with patience, and made me feel truly heard and seen. That alone meant the world to me.\n\nBut what he gave me, what this surgery gave me, is so much more than physical. He gave me a second chance at life. Because of him, I now wake up with hope. Because of him, I have the strength and the tools to be the mother my four year old daughter deserves. I chose this path for her and for myself, and I will forever be grateful to Dr. Niruben for walking alongside me on this journey.\n\nHis kindness, his expertise, and the unwavering support from his entire team in made me feel safe every step of the way. I truly believe God works through people, and Dr. Niruben is one of those people. What he’s doing isn’t just medicine, it’s life transformation.\n\nTo anyone considering this journey, if you’re looking for a surgeon who will not only guide you medically but support you unconditionally, Dr. Niruben is the one. I would recommend him in a heartbeat.\n\nThank you, Dr. Niruben.\nMay God bless you and your incredible team for the lives you’re changing, including mine.\n\nForever grateful,\nA Healthier, Hopeful Me ♥️",

I truly appreciate your intuition in identifying multiple gallstones through an ultrasound, especially as I initially came to you for a different procedure. Your successful removal of my gallbladder has made a significant positive impact on my health, helping with a decent amount of the gastrointestinal pain I’ve been experiencing. I'm grateful for the thoughtful, compassionate care you and your team provided from before the procedure Anne post operative care also, particularly in light of my chronic pain and other conditions. Your genuine concern for my well-being, both before and after surgery, made me feel supported and confident throughout the process.

The next morning after surgery, he came to visit me and explained that the ultra sound did actually show how large the hernia was and that the mesh they had put in 20yrs ago was entangled with the hernia and fat tissue. A week ater the surgery I had a huge bump measuring 4 inch long and about 2 in thck. contacted his office and he sent me for immediate ultra sound and to have it aspirated which they wanted $550 and no claiming. He said for me to visit his office the next morning before having it aspirated. He looked at it and aspirated it himself in his office and said that $550 was obsered to pay.\nI have now had my visit after 6wks and he was very happy with the out come and for me to massage it for 15mins a day as he didn't put a another mesh instead sewed the muscles together and all will go back to normal. As a surgeon of his callebar he is a very down to earth and carring human being. All the staff are very polite and caring just like himself. Thank Prof Sandroussi.",

He is the only one who took an interest in getting to the bottom of my father’s illness and finding the root cause! Teresa, the receptionist is just amazing too - responded to all my emails quickly and helped me get the answers I needed. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!",

He was very good and had procedures in place so that my visits to Sydney were planned in advance and most consultations were via Skype which is very convenient for country patients. He and his team are very professional and always very helpful and I would have not hesitation in recommending his to anyone who is in need of a skilled and professional surgeon. Thankyou and good luck to you in the future.",

Dr Falk takes the time to explain everything to you and generally cares for his patience wellbeing. I also have to say the follow up from both Teresa and Dr Falk is excellent. I have just recently come out of surgery this week with Dr Falk and as expected he did an excellent job and was a very quick time between the initial phone call with him and the day of surgery. Thanks Teresa and Dr Falk I appreciate all what you have done for me and would highly recommend to anyone.",
