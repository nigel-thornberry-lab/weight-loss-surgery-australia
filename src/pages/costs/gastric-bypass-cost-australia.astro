  {
    question: "How much does gastric bypass surgery cost in Australia?",
    answer: "Gastric bypass surgery costs between $4,500 and $7,624 with private health insurance, or $18,000 to $26,000 without insurance in Australia (2025). The total cost depends on your surgeon, hospital, location, and insurance status. Medicare provides a rebate of $816."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does gastric bypass cost more than gastric sleeve?",
    answer: "Gastric bypass costs more because it's a more complex procedure requiring intestinal rerouting, longer operating time (2-4 hours vs 1-2 hours), higher surgical expertise, more intensive follow-up care, and lifelong vitamin supplementation. The Medicare rebate is also higher ($816 vs $663), reflecting the increased complexity."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Medicare cover gastric bypass surgery?",
    answer: "Medicare provides a partial rebate of $816 for gastric bypass surgery (MBS Item 30515) if you meet medical criteria (BMI ≥35 with obesity-related conditions, or BMI ≥40). You also receive an anaesthetist rebate of approximately $300 (Item 17610). However, Medicare doesn't cover the full cost - you'll still have significant out-of-pocket expenses."
  },
  {
    question: "Will private health insurance cover my gastric bypass?",
    answer: "Private health insurance with Gold-tier hospital cover can significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs to $4,500-$7,624. However, you must serve a 12-month waiting period for bariatric surgery. Check with your fund about specific gap fees, excess payments, and whether your surgeon has a gap cover arrangement."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the hidden costs of gastric bypass surgery?",
    answer: "Hidden costs include pre-surgery requirements ($1,900-$4,100 for dietitian, psychologist, medical tests), post-surgery needs ($1,450-$4,100 for vitamins, follow-ups, complications), and lifestyle changes ($1,100-$45,200 for new wardrobe, skin removal surgery, gym memberships). Budget an additional $4,450-$53,400 beyond the surgery cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I finance gastric bypass surgery in Australia?",
    answer: "Yes, financing options include Total Lifestyle Credit (TLC) with approved payment plans for bariatric surgery, personal medical loans from banks at 6-12% interest, early superannuation release for eligible medical conditions, and some hospital payment plans. Most patients pay between $200-$500 per month over 3-5 years."
  },
  {
    question: "Is gastric bypass tax deductible in Australia?",
    answer: "Yes, gastric bypass surgery can be tax deductible if it's medically necessary (not cosmetic). You can claim out-of-pocket medical expenses above $2,759 (2024-25 threshold) through the net medical expenses tax offset. Keep all receipts from your surgeon, hospital, specialists, and follow-up care."
  },
  {
    question: "What's cheaper: gastric bypass or gastric sleeve in Australia?",
    answer: "Gastric sleeve is typically $500-$2,000 cheaper than gastric bypass. With insurance, sleeve costs $3,500-$7,000 vs bypass at $4,500-$7,624. Without insurance, sleeve costs $15,000-$20,000 vs bypass at $18,000-$26,000. However, bypass may be more cost-effective long-term if you need maximum weight loss or have severe diabetes."
  },
  {
    question: "How much do gastric bypass vitamins cost per year?",
    answer: "Gastric bypass patients spend $600-$1,200 per year on vitamins and supplements (significantly more than gastric sleeve). You'll need lifelong daily multivitamins, calcium citrate, vitamin D, vitamin B12 injections, and iron supplements. Budget $50-$100 per month for high-quality bariatric vitamins."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any free or low-cost gastric bypass options in Australia?",
    answer: "Public hospital waitlists exist for patients with severe obesity and life-threatening conditions, but wait times are 2-5+ years and acceptance criteria are extremely strict. Some surgeons offer payment plans or reduced fees for financial hardship cases. However, most Australians access surgery through private health insurance or medical financing."
