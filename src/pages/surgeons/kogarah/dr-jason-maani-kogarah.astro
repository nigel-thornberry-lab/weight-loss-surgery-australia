    {
      "q": "What is the consultation process with Dr Jason Maani?",
      "a": "Your first consultation involves an in-depth review of your medical history, discussion of your weight loss journey, and a physical assessment. Dr Maani and his team take time to understand each patient's personal concerns and goals, ensuring a tailored approach to your care. You will learn about available surgical and non-surgical options, the risks and benefits, and any necessary pre-operative investigations."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which bariatric procedures does Dr Maani offer?",
      "a": "Dr Maani is highly trained in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, and other advanced bariatric surgeries, along with revisional (redo) bariatric procedures. He also consults on general and upper gastrointestinal surgery and provides access to weight loss medications when appropriate."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the typical recovery time after bariatric surgery?",
      "a": "Most patients spend 2-3 days in hospital following surgery. You can expect to return to light activities within 1-2 weeks, depending on individual progress and procedure type. Full recovery, including a return to normal physical activity, may take 4-6 weeks."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does the follow-up care involve?",
      "a": "Comprehensive follow-up is core to Dr Maani's practice. This includes scheduled post-operative reviews, dietary guidance, and ongoing support from his multidisciplinary team to help you achieve and sustain your weight loss goals. Long-term monitoring is encouraged for best results."
    },
    {
      "q": "How are costs and insurance handled?",
      "a": "Costs depend on the procedure and your level of private health insurance coverage. Many bariatric surgeries may receive partial or full coverage via private health funds; patients without insurance will be advised about self-funding options and out-of-pocket expenses during their initial consult. Dr Maani's staff can help clarify coverage details relevant to your circumstances."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is revision (redo) bariatric surgery available?",
      "a": "Yes, Dr Maani has advanced expertise in revisional bariatric surgery for patients with previous weight loss operations who have experienced complications or insufficient weight loss. Each case is individually assessed to determine the safest and most effective revision option."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the waiting time for bariatric surgery?",
      "a": "Waiting periods vary based on health fund approvals, necessary pre-operative investigations, and hospital scheduling. Typically, once preparatory steps are completed, surgery can be booked within several weeks to a couple of months. Exact timelines are provided after your initial consultation."
    },
    {
      "q": "What makes Dr Maani's practice unique?",
      "a": "Unhurried, personalized care, comprehensive follow-up, and a focus on holistic, long-term weight loss distinguish Dr Maani's approach. He is noted for his warm and understanding manner, strong patient relationships, and commitment to the latest minimally invasive surgical techniques. His team's ongoing support is a key feature."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the risks of bariatric surgery?",
      "a": "Risks depend on the procedure but may include bleeding, infection, leaks, blood clots, reflux, and nutritional deficiencies. Dr Maani provides a detailed discussion of risks and benefits tailored to each patient, and all procedures are carried out according to the highest standards of safety."
    },
    {
      "q": "What lifestyle changes are required after surgery?",
      "a": "Successful, long-term weight loss depends on committing to major lifestyle changes. You will need to follow a specialized diet, increase physical activity, take recommended vitamin supplements, and attend ongoing follow-up appointments. Dr Maani and his team provide extensive education and support to help you adapt to these changes and achieve lasting results."
