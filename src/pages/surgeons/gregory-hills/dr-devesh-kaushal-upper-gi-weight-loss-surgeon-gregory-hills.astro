    {
      "q": "What is the process for my first consultation with Dr Devesh Kaushal?",
      "a": "Your initial consultation involves a detailed medical assessment, review of any relevant test results (please bring these), and discussion of your surgical and non-surgical options. Arrive 10 minutes early for paperwork, and you are welcome to bring a support person. Telehealth consultations are also available if needed."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who is part of the multidisciplinary team, and what are their roles?",
      "a": "The team includes Dietitian Claudia for nutritional support, a psychologist for mental health and readiness, and an exercise physiologist for tailored physical activity plans. They work collaboratively with Dr Kaushal to optimize your outcomes before and after surgery."
    },
    {
      "q": "What types of bariatric surgery does Dr Kaushal perform?",
      "a": "Dr Kaushal specializes in gastric sleeve surgery and other minimally invasive (laparoscopic) weight loss procedures. He also has expertise in upper-GI and colorectal surgery, as well as advanced endoscopic procedures."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does it take to recover from bariatric surgery?",
      "a": "Most patients stay in hospital for a few days post-surgery and can resume light activities within 1-2 weeks, with a gradual return to normal activities over several weeks. Comprehensive follow-up care is provided to support your recovery and monitor for complications."
    },
    {
      "q": "What follow-up care will I receive after surgery?",
      "a": "Scheduled post-operative appointments are arranged to monitor healing and progress. Ongoing care includes consultations with the dietitian, psychologist, and exercise physiologist as needed. Regular check-ins allow for any adjustments to your care plan and long-term support."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the costs, and is surgery covered by insurance?",
      "a": "Dr Kaushal's clinic is a private practice; there are reasonable out-of-pocket costs for consultations and procedures. Private health insurance may cover substantial hospital fees, but self-funded options are available. Medicare rebates are possible for some follow-up services but not for the first consultation."
    },

    },
    {
      "q": "How long are the waiting times for appointments and surgery?",
      "a": "While every effort is made to run on time, occasional delays may occur due to complex case needs. You will be informed if there are scheduling delays. Same-day cancellations may incur a fee. Exact waiting times for surgery depend on medical urgency and hospital availability."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does the typical patient journey look like?",
