<ul>
  <li>💪 <strong>Protein:</strong> Target 60-80g daily (use shakes to hit this goal)</li>
  <li>💧 <strong>Fluids:</strong> 1.5L daily minimum</li>
  <li>🚶 <strong>Walking:</strong> 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times daily</li>
  <li>😴 <strong>Energy:</strong> Still low, naps common (but improving!)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Diet specifics:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>🥤 6-8 small "meals" per day</li>

  <p style="margin: 0; color: #78350f;"><strong>The Solution:</strong> Try 5-6 different brands/flavors. Freeze protein shakes for "ice cream" texture. Try clear protein drinks (Isopure). Mix with coffee for a mocha shake. Warm soups provide comfort and variety.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">Is it normal to feel exhausted after gastric sleeve?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Yes, extreme fatigue is normal for Weeks 1-6 after gastric sleeve. Your body is healing from major surgery while consuming very few calories. Energy improves significantly by Week 4 and returns to near-normal by Week 6-8. Protein intake, hydration, and gentle walking help.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Walking can begin Day 1 post-surgery. Light cardio (cycling, elliptical) can begin Week 4. Full exercise including weights can begin Week 6-8 with surgeon clearance. Always start gradually and increase intensity slowly over 3 months.</p>
