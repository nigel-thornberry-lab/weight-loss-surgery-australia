  <div class="faq-question">Can I get gastric sleeve surgery free in Australia?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Yes, through public hospitals if you meet strict eligibility criteria (usually BMI 40+ with serious health conditions). However, waiting lists are <strong>1-3 years long</strong>. Some out-of-pocket costs may still apply ($0-$500 for medications and tests). Private health insurance provides much faster access—12-month waiting period plus 2-4 weeks to surgery versus years in the public system.</p>

  <div class="faq-question">What payment plans are available for gastric sleeve surgery?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Medical finance providers (TLC Finance, MacCredit, Latitude) offer payment plans from <strong>$200-$650 per month</strong> over 12-60 months with interest rates of 7.95%-17.95%. Some offer interest-free periods (6-12 months). Example: $20,000 surgery financed at 9.95% over 36 months = $645/month. Some surgeons offer in-house payment plans (often interest-free, 3-12 months).</p>

  <div class="faq-question">Does private health insurance cover gastric sleeve surgery?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Yes, <strong>Gold-level hospital cover</strong> typically covers gastric sleeve surgery after a <strong>12-month waiting period</strong>. Insurance covers hospital and theatre fees (100% after excess), but you still pay gap fees to surgeon and anaesthetist (<strong>$5,000-$12,000 typical</strong>). Always confirm bariatric surgery is included in your specific policy before relying on coverage. Hospital excess of $250-$750 applies.</p>
