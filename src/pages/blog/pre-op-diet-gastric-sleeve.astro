  <h2 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">Your Complete 2-Week Roadmap to Surgery Success</h2>
  <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.95); font-size: 1.125rem;">The pre-op diet is often harder than recovery itself. <strong>2 weeks (sometimes 4) of restrictive eating before surgery.</strong> But it's medically critical—NOT optional. It shrinks your liver by 15-30%, making surgery safer. Surgery may be cancelled if you don't follow it. This guide provides everything: WHY, WHAT, HOW, meal plans, and survival tips.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box blue">
  <h4>🏥 Based on OSSANZ & Dietitians Australia Guidelines</h4>
  <p><strong>Key stats you need to know:</strong></p>
  <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Liver shrinks <strong>15-30%</strong> in just 2 weeks on pre-op diet</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Surgery cancelled for <strong>5-10% of patients</strong> due to non-compliance</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Following pre-op diet reduces surgical complications by <strong>40%</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin: 0; color: #78350f;">Thousands complete this diet successfully every month. It's challenging, but you're stronger than you think. Here's exactly how to succeed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why the Pre-Op Diet Exists (The Medical Science)</h2>

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef2f2 0%, #fee2e2 100%); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2.5rem 0; border-left: 6px solid #ef4444; box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <h3 style="color: #991b1b; margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; font-size: 1.75rem; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 0.75rem;">🫀 The Liver Problem</h3>
  
  <p style="color: #7f1d1d; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0;">Understanding WHY you need this diet makes it easier to stick to. It's not about willpower—it's about your safety.</p>

  <div style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.7); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h4 style="color: #991b1b; margin-top: 0;">Where Your Liver Sits:</h4>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #7f1d1d;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Located on right side of abdomen, just above your stomach</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">During surgery, surgeon must lift/move liver to access stomach</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">In obese patients, liver is often enlarged and fatty (NAFLD)</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Enlarged liver = difficult surgery, higher complication risk</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Fatty Liver Facts</h3>

<h3>How Pre-Op Diet Helps (The Science)</h3>

<div style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #d1fae5 0%, #a7f3d0 100%); border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <h4 style="color: #065f46; margin-top: 0;">✅ How It Works:</h4>
  <ol style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #064e3b;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Low-calorie, low-carb diet forces liver to use stored glycogen</strong></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Each glycogen molecule holds 3-4 water molecules</strong></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Liver rapidly releases glycogen + water = shrinks dramatically</strong></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Liver can shrink 15-30% in just 2 weeks!</strong></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Smaller liver = easier, safer surgery</strong></li>
  </ol>

      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Surgeon assesses liver size during surgery</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">If too large = unsafe to proceed → Surgery cancelled</li>

      <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Must restart pre-op diet, wait weeks to reschedule</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #fef3c7 0%, #fde68a 100%); border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
    <h4 style="color: #92400e; margin-top: 0;">📊 Increased Complication Risk</h4>
    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #78350f;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Higher bleeding risk (liver more fragile)</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Longer surgery time (more anesthesia exposure)</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Increased infection risk</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Possible conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery</li>

  <h4>💬 Surgeon Perspective:</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic;">"The pre-op diet is as important as the surgery itself. We can visually see the difference between patients who followed it vs. those who didn't. It's not about punishment—it's about your safety."</p>

    <h3 style="color: #1e40af; margin: 0 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem;">Option 1: Optifast (Meal Replacement)</h3>
    
    <p style="color: #1e3a8a; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>What it is:</strong> Complete meal replacement shakes, 3-4 shakes per day (800-1,000 calories total), nutritionally complete, no solid food.</p>

    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
      <div style="background: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">
        <h4 style="color: #065f46; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1rem;">✅ Pros:</h4>
        <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.25rem; color: #064e3b; font-size: 0.95rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Simple (no meal planning)</li>

          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Expensive ($100-$150 for 2 weeks)</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Boring (same flavor daily)</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Taste aversion common</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">Social situations difficult</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="color: #1e3a8a; margin: 0;"><strong>Who it's for:</strong> Patients who need simplicity, surgeon requires it, or want zero meal planning.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #065f46; margin: 0 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem;">Option 2: DIY Low-Carb, Low-Calorie Diet</h3>
    
    <p style="color: #064e3b; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>What it is:</strong> 800-1,000 calories daily, &lt;50g carbs, high protein (60-80g), small portions of solid food.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #92400e; margin: 0 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem;">Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Most Common) ⭐</h3>
    
    <p style="color: #78350f; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>What it is:</strong> 2 meal replacement shakes + 1 small low-carb meal (dinner), 800-1,000 calories total.</p>

    <div style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.6); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">

        <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Dinner:</strong> Grilled chicken + vegetables (small portion)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p style="color: #78350f;"><strong>✅ Pros:</strong> Best of both worlds, social meal possible (dinner), easier to sustain 2 weeks, still very effective.</p>
    <p style="color: #78350f; margin: 0;"><strong>Who it's for:</strong> Most patients (most flexible), family meals important, need one "real" meal daily.</p>

  <div style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #dbeafe 0%, #bfdbfe 100%); border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
    <h3 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.25rem;">💪 Physical Strategies</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #1e3a8a;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Stay Busy:</strong> Boredom = thinking about food. Schedule activities—work, errands, hobbies. Go to bed early (less awake time = less hunger).</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Drink Constantly:</strong> Water is your best friend (aim for 2-3L daily). Herbal teas help. Diet soda OK (if surgeon allows). Cold water reduces appetite.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Eat Slowly:</strong> Make your small meal last 30 minutes. Chew thoroughly. Put fork down between bites. Savor every bite.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Exercise (Light):</strong> Walking helps manage hunger. Don't overdo it (low energy). 20-30 minute walks ideal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #6b21a8; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.25rem;">🧠 Mental Strategies</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #581c87;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Reframe Your Mindset:</strong> Not a "diet"—it's medical preparation. You're preparing for surgery. 2 weeks is temporary. This is proof you can do hard things.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Plan for Social Situations:</strong> Tell friends/family you're preparing for surgery. Avoid restaurants if possible. If must go out: Order protein + vegetables, eat half. Don't attend food-focused events.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Join Support Groups:</strong> Online bariatric surgery groups. Find others doing pre-op diet. Share struggles, tips, encouragement. Accountability helps.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Visual Reminders:</strong> Write surgery date on calendar. Count down days. Remember WHY you're doing this. Picture post-surgery success.</li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-section" style="margin: 2.5rem 0;">
  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">How long is the pre-op diet for gastric sleeve surgery?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Most surgeons require a 2-week (14-day) pre-op diet before gastric sleeve surgery. Some surgeons require 3-4 weeks depending on BMI and liver size. The diet typically consists of 800-1,000 calories daily with high protein and low carbs to shrink the liver by 15-30%.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">Can I cheat on my pre-op diet before gastric sleeve?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">No, cheating on the pre-op diet risks surgery cancellation, increased complications, and longer recovery. The diet medically shrinks your liver to make surgery safer. Cheating reverses progress within hours. If you cheat significantly, inform your surgeon immediately—surgery may need to be postponed for your safety.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">What can I eat on the pre-op diet for gastric sleeve?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Common pre-op diet options include: Protein shakes (3-4 daily) OR lean protein (chicken, fish) + non-starchy vegetables in small portions. Allowed: Greek yogurt (no fat), sugar-free jelly, water, herbal tea. Avoided: Carbs (bread, pasta, rice), sugar, fruit, alcohol, high-fat foods. Follow YOUR surgeon's specific plan.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">What is Optifast and do I have to use it?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Optifast is a complete meal replacement shake program used for pre-op diets. It's NOT mandatory for all patients—many surgeons allow DIY low-carb, high-protein diets instead. Optifast pros: Simple, nutritionally complete. Cons: Expensive ($100-150 for 2 weeks), boring flavor. Ask your surgeon about alternatives.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">Why do I need a pre-op diet for gastric sleeve surgery?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">The pre-op diet shrinks your fatty liver by 15-30% in 2 weeks, making surgery safer. An enlarged liver blocks access to your stomach during surgery, increasing bleeding risk, surgery time, and complications. The low-calorie, low-carb diet forces your liver to release stored glycogen and water, rapidly shrinking it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">What are the side effects of the pre-op diet?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Common Week 1 side effects: Intense hunger (Days 2-4), headaches (Days 1-3), fatigue, irritability, constipation, bad breath (ketosis). By Week 2, hunger reduces significantly as ketosis is achieved. Manage side effects with: Hydration (2-3L daily), rest, sugar-free jelly, paracetamol for headaches.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">Can I exercise during the pre-op diet?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Yes, light exercise like walking (20-30 minutes daily) is encouraged and helps manage hunger. Avoid intense exercise—you're on very low calories (800-1,000 daily) and will have low energy. Listen to your body. Exercise helps distract from hunger but conserve energy for healing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <h3 style="color: #1f2937; font-size: 1.125rem; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0;">How much weight will I lose on the pre-op diet?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Most patients lose 3-8kg during the 2-week pre-op diet. Weight loss varies based on starting weight, adherence, and metabolism. This weight loss is bonus but NOT the primary goal—liver shrinkage is the goal. Expect rapid water weight loss in first 3-4 days, then steady fat loss.</p>
