## Email Body

Hi,

You're 12 days into your research. If you're still reading these emails, you're probably getting closer to booking a consultation.

Before you do, let's talk about **how to choose a surgeon**â€”because this decision matters more than most people realize.

---

## The Non-Negotiables

### 1. FRACS Qualification (Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons)

This is your baseline. **FRACS** means the surgeon has:
- Completed medical school
- Completed surgical training (minimum 5 years)
- Passed rigorous examinations
- Met ongoing professional development requirements

**Why it matters**: FRACS is the gold standard for surgical training in Australia and New Zealand. Non-FRACS surgeons may be qualified in other countries, but FRACS ensures Australian regulatory oversight.

**How to check**: Ask directly, check their website, or verify through the RACS public register.

---

### 2. Specific Bariatric/Upper GI Training

General surgeons can technically perform bariatric surgery, but you want someone who specializes in it.

**Look for:**
- Advanced training in bariatric or upper gastrointestinal surgery
- Membership in ANZMOSS (Australia and New Zealand Metabolic and Obesity Surgery Society)
- Regular attendance at bariatric conferences
- Evidence of ongoing professional development in bariatric surgery

**Why it matters**: Techniques, best practices, and device technology evolve. You want a surgeon who stays current.

---

### 3. Hospital Admitting Privileges

Your surgeon should operate at an accredited private hospital (or public hospital for public patients).

**Why it matters**: 
- Hospital credentialing provides an additional layer of oversight
- Access to emergency support if complications arise
- Better equipment and surgical teams

**Red flag**: Surgeons who only operate at day surgery centers or clinics without full hospital backup.

---

### 4. Comprehensive Pre-Op Program

Quality bariatric surgeons require:
- Dietitian consultations (pre and post-op)
- Psychology assessment
- Medical clearance (bloods, imaging, cardiac assessment if needed)
- Education sessions about the procedure and lifestyle changes

**Red flag**: Surgeons who offer surgery after a single consultation with minimal assessment.

---

## Questions to Ask at Your Consultation

### About Their Experience

**"How many of this specific procedure have you performed?"**
- Look for: At least 50-100 of the procedure you're considering
- No definitive "magic number," but more experience generally means better outcomes

**"What is your complication rate?"**
- Every surgeon has complicationsâ€”it's part of surgery
- They should be able to discuss this openly
- National averages: serious complications occur in 1-5% of cases depending on the procedure, typically within 30 days of surgery

**"What happens if I have a complication?"**
- Who do I call?
- How quickly can I be seen?
- What hospital will I go to?
- Are you available 24/7 or is there a covering surgeon?

---

### About Their Approach

**"What's your typical pre-op program timeline?"**
- Shorter is not better
- Rushed timelines suggest inadequate preparation

**"Do you have a psychologist on your team?"**
- This should be mandatory, not optional

**"What does your post-op follow-up look like?"**
- How often will I see you?
- For how long?
- Is there a dietitian or nurse available between appointments?
- What support is available if I'm struggling?

**"What's your revision rate?"**
- Some patients need additional procedures (slipped bands, strictures, hernias)
- Surgeons should track and discuss this

---

### About Costs

**"What's included in your quoted price?"**
- Surgeon fee
- Anaesthetist fee
- Hospital stay
- Follow-up appointments (how many?)
- What's NOT included?

**"Do you offer payment plans?"**
- Interest rates
- Minimum deposit
- What happens if I can't make a payment?

---

### About Philosophy

**"Why did you specialize in bariatric surgery?"**
- Their answer should reflect respect for patients, not profit motive

**"What do you think are the biggest challenges patients face?"**
- Should demonstrate understanding of psychological and lifestyle challenges, not just technical surgery talk

**"When do you recommend **against** surgery?"**
- Good surgeons turn patients away when timing or circumstances aren't right

## Red Flags (Run, Don't Walk)

ðŸš© **Guaranteed outcomes** ("You'll lose 50kg in 12 months")  
ðŸš© **Pressure tactics** ("Book today to get this price")  
ðŸš© **Dismissing risks** ("It's completely safe" or "Recovery is easy")  
ðŸš© **Rushed timeline** (Consultation to surgery in under 4 weeks with no medical emergency)  
ðŸš© **No psychology requirement**  
ðŸš© **Vague credentials** (Won't discuss training, experience, or complication rates)  
ðŸš© **No hospital affiliation** (Only operates in day clinics)  
ðŸš© **Poor communication** (Doesn't return calls, staff are dismissive, you feel uncomfortable asking questions)  
ðŸš© **Comparing themselves to other surgeons** ("I'm better than Dr X")  
ðŸš© **Limited or no post-op support** ("You'll only need one follow-up")  
ðŸš© **Making you feel ashamed** (Any language that's judgmental about your weight)

**Trust your gut.** If something feels off, consult with another surgeon.
