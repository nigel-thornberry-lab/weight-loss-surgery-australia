## Email Body

Hi,

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: **money**.

This is often the most stressful part of researching weight loss surgery, and we get it. Most websites either hide the costs entirely or throw around vague ranges that don't help you plan.

Here's what you actually need to budget for.

---

## The Base Cost

**Gastric sleeve surgery in Australia typically costs $15,000-$25,000.**

This usually includes:
- Surgeon's fee
- Anaesthetist's fee
- Hospital stay (1-2 nights)
- Basic post-operative follow-up

**Gastric bypass** tends to be slightly higher ($18,000-$28,000) due to increased surgical complexity.

**Gastric band** is typically lower ($12,000-$18,000), though band procedures have become less common in recent years.

**Important**: These are typical ranges. Your quote may vary based on:
- Your location (city vs. regional)
- Hospital choice (private facility)
- Surgeon's experience and reputation
- Your specific health circumstances
- Additional procedures (e.g., hernia repair)

## The Hidden Costs (Budget for These)

**Before Surgery:**
- Initial consultations: $200-$500 per specialist
- Medical tests and assessments: $500-$1,500
- Pre-op diet supplies: $200-$400
- Psychology assessment: $200-$400

**After Surgery:**
- Vitamin supplements: $30-$80/month (lifelong)
- Protein supplements: $50-$100/month (first 6-12 months)
- New wardrobe: $500-$2,000+ (over 12-18 months)
- Dietitian follow-up: $100-$200 per session
- Potential excess skin removal (if desired): $8,000-$20,000+ per area

**Total realistic budget**: $18,000-$32,000+ for the first year, depending on procedure and individual needs.

## How Australians Are Paying for This

### 1. Private Health Insurance

If you have hospital cover with weight loss surgery included:
- **Medicare rebate**: ~$1,400-$1,800 for eligible procedures
- **Private health fund benefit**: Varies widely ($5,000-$15,000 depending on your level of cover)
- **Your out-of-pocket**: Typically $5,000-$15,000

**Waiting periods apply**: Usually 12 months for bariatric surgery from the date you upgraded your cover.

**Check your policy**: Not all policies cover weight loss surgery, and some exclude it entirely.

---

### 2. Superannuation Early Release

This is a lesser-known option that many Australians qualify for.

You may be able to access your super early on **compassionate grounds** if:
- You need medical treatment for a life-threatening condition, or
- You need medical treatment to alleviate acute or chronic pain, or
- You need medical treatment to alleviate acute or chronic mental disturbance

**Eligible conditions**: Type 2 diabetes, severe sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, severe joint problems, and other obesity-related conditions.

**Amount**: You can apply to access the amount needed for the treatment.

**Tax**: Amounts released are taxed at your marginal rate (not as super withdrawal).

**Process**: You'll need supporting documentation from your GP and surgeon. Applications are submitted to the ATO.

### 3. Payment Plans

Many surgeons and hospitals offer:
- Interest-free periods (6-24 months)
- Medical finance through providers like TLC, Mac Credit, or Zip Money
- Typical interest rates: 0% (promotional) to 15-20%

**Be cautious**: Missed payments can result in high interest charges being applied retrospectively.

---

### 4. Self-Funding

Some people save for surgery, use personal loans, or access other savings (inheritance, investment returns, partner support).

**Personal loan rates** currently sit around 6-15% depending on your credit rating and lender.

## Is It "Worth It"? (The Honest Answer)

We can't answer that for you—and anyone who tries to is oversimplifying.

**What we can say:**
- Most people report the physical health benefits (improved diabetes, sleep apnoea, joint pain) justify the cost
- The psychological and social adjustments are harder than expected
- Long-term success requires ongoing investment (supplements, follow-up care, potential revisions)

**What to consider:**
- If you have obesity-related health conditions, the cost of **not** treating them (medication, GP visits, lost work capacity) adds up over time
- This is a significant financial commitment—if it stretches your budget to breaking point, factor in stress as a health consideration
- Some people regret rushing into surgery before being emotionally ready
